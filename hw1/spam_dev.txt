Subject: quick notelouise :i just wanted to send you a quick note with the hope that you might have a chance to read your e - mail . it seemed more awkward to me to try and catch you in person giving the frenetic pace and fluidity of our situation .basically all i want to tell you is that i ' m here to help in this process , and encourage you to let me know if there is anything else in particular i can help on . i have spoken and offered the same directly to miller , calger and duran . i ' m not telling folks this out of lack of current work flow . as i think you know , the development group is in the middle of several active transactions that we expect to close in the near term , and we remain keenly focused on making these deals happen ( as evidenced by the $ 1 . 375 million doyle insurance settlement finalized today ) .i ' m approaching you and others specifically because i have 2 years of chapter 11 bankruptcy experience . prior to me joining enron in may of 1998 , i was with kenetech corporation ( a 1 , 200 employee publicly traded ipp ) . in 1996 ( after having worked as an originator at kenetech since 1990 ) , kenetech filed for chapter 11 . as part of the chapter 11 process , i was one of 6 senior commercial employees retained by the company to be responsible for liquidating the company ' s assets . as such , i am very familiar with the chapter 11 process , and how deals get done in this context . enron is obviously of a far greater magnitude , but i believe the basic skills and experience are directly applicable .again , as we go through this process , i just wanted to make you aware of my experience in this area , and let you know that i stand ready , willing and eager to take on additional tasks .with respect to our current deal flow , i also wanted to let you know we are working on the following which i will get to you by friday ( or earlier if need be ) :1 . transaction list , status , and valuation ;2 . site bank summary and exit / monetization strategy ;3 . projected site bank maintenance budget .i will , of course , also provide this information to miller , calger and duran .best regards ,ben

Subject: needles / topock price differentialsi have had a casual chat with some of my accounts regarding their opinion ofthe market dynamics affecting the needles to topock price differentials .each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of topock gassupplies , rather than the incremental intra - state transport costs required totransport to the pg & e citygate , as the primary driving force for the needlesto topock price differential .here is a recurring theme i heard from my customers : the el paso merchantservice ( epms ) 1 . 2 bcf contract ' s block ii capacity ( 500 mmcf / d of permian topg & e / topock capacity , $ . 065 transport rate ) has a re - callable aspect . ifepms schedules gas under the transport of block ii capacity to any othercalifornia delivery point other than pg & e / topock , then other parties mayrecall the capacity for their own use to pg & e / topock . currently duke hasrecalled 100 mmcf / d and pg & e energy trading has also recalled 100 mmcf / d fortheir use to transport permian gas to pg & e / topock . ( fyi - epmc may re - recallthis capacity , but they have elected not to ) . these additional topocksupplies coming from duke and pg & e energy trading under block ii capacity maybe viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to pg & e at topock . this gascompetes head to head with malin gas prices . for example , today ' s malinprice is $ 4 . 62 while pg & e / topock price is $ 4 . 69 . today ' s cash pricedifferential between needles and topock is $ . 60 , far larger than thepreviously assumed $ . 28 differential resulting from the intrastate costrequired to bring topock gas to the citygate .if anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding thesemarket dynamics , let ' s discuss further at our next staff meeting . cs

Subject: update on retention & severance planwe know how interested all of you are in the retention & severance plan , so we want to update you on its status .as many of you know , we have been working with members of the creditors ' committee and their consultants since december to formulate a retention & severance plan , and we formally presented the plan to the committee on friday , february 22 . we had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month .we know that many of you have career options outside of enron and that the retention & severance plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave . we sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed . we ' re learning that , in bankruptcy , most things don ' t move as quickly as we are accustomed .the committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan , but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns . the creditors ' committee fully supports the implementation of a retention & severance plan . such plans align the company ' s objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy . these plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate .the creditors ' committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process . to that end , we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee . we intend to work hand - in - hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible . this is currently our top priority , bar none !when we filed for bankruptcy , we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be . unfortunately , that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place .we now know that it takes significant time , resources and effort to understand , identify and gather the massive volume of required details , to formulate that information into a reasonable program , and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation . the process mirrors the most time - intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which enron has been involved . that serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse .we remain committed to working with the creditors ' committee until we can reach agreement on a plan . we anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so , and have targeted the week of march 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court . we will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court .with respect to non - debtor companies , or those companies not in bankruptcy , new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future .in the meantime , we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week .and of course , we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible .

Subject: hey guys , i would like to get with you to discuss our hedge policies . i am concerned about the recent accounting around the wind hedge ( and not necessarlily the outcome in this particular case ! ) . if the outcome had been reversed ( ie . a loss on the hedges existed ) we would have had no choice but to book it . the issue is that nobody commmunicated or documented the designation of these positions as hedges of the " wind " ppa . it occurs to me that we do not have any process that requires coodination when you set up an accrual book . as you know the designation criteria are rigid for acctg purposes . if we miss it , we can ' t cure it and the acctg would be mtm for the life of the contracts . i will set a metting to discuss .wes

Subject: lessons in hara - kiri , latin versionmexico- power strike set for march 16 in mexico citysome 35 , 000 members of the mexican union of electrical workers plan to strike the mexico city electric company on friday , march 16 th at 12 noon . the union is demanding a 29 percent salary increase and the company is offering nothing . the two sides are not even talking . the union is concerned that the government may try to force the electrical workers to stay on their jobs or bring in replacements . the union is also opposed to the privatization of the electric company and its leader has charged that privatization would bring higher electric rates to meet the profit demands of foreign investors . the company principally provides electrical service to mexico city and the states of mexico , morelos , hidalgo and puebla . it may be prudent to begin planning for possible power shortages in these regions .

Subject: senate approves edison rescue deal , assembly measure stalledby jennifer colemanassociated press writersacramento ( ap ) - - the state senate approved a bill that significantly alters the plan negotiated by gov . gray davis to help the struggling utility southern california edison .the bill approved friday , authored by democratic sens . richard polanco and byron sher , lets edison issue $ 2 . 5 billion in revenue bonds to pay debts amassed when prices for wholesale electricity reached record - high levels in the last year ." i believe it ' s a measure that gets us to the goal of getting the state out of the business of buying electricity . . . and to bring this entity to creditworthiness , " said polanco , d - los angeles .approved 22 - 17 , the bill now goes to the assembly . the assembly adjourned friday night without voting on a similar measure .the polanco - sher plan shifts the burden of repaying the bonds to commercial and industrial power users and has been opposed by business interests and by edison , which says it won ' t help the company escape bankruptcy .davis ' plan , announced in april , offers edison $ 2 . 76 billion for its transmission system and lets it sell revenue bonds to repay the rest of its estimated $ 3 . 5 billion worth of debt generated when it had to pay skyrocketing wholesale power prices .under the plan by polanco , and sher , of stanford , the state has a five - year option to buy edison ' s grid .that , said republican sen . ross johnson of irvine , gives edison a bailout it " neither needs nor deserves ." i am tired of this projection of edison as a victim . they have their legion of lobbyists here telling us ad nauseam that they didn ' t support deregulation , " johnson said during floor debate . " the idea of edison as the victim goes down in the annals of real whoppers . edison paid their lobbyists bonuses for the successful passage of deregulation . "during the 1995 - 1996 deliberations that led to deregulation , edison officials helped create the current system in meetings with business interests and then - gov . pete wilson , a republican .lawmakers are set to go on summer break friday night until aug . 20 , a schedule that conflicts with the deadline in the memorandum of understanding between davis and edison . that says the legislature must approve the deal by aug . 15 ." it ' s a firm deadline , which means this issue has to be fully resolved prior to the end of the legislative recess , " davis said friday .for that to happen , either the senate bill or a proposal by assembly speaker robert hertzberg , d - van nuys , and assemblyman fred keeley , d - boulder creek , has to reach davis ." i have problems with both bills , " davis said . " i am heartened by the fact that there ' s a bill moving in each house . "the keeley - hertzberg plan trims at least $ 300 million from the governor ' s offer . it also allows edison to issue the bonds , which would be repaid by edison ratepayers over 10 years .the plan also attempts to increase the state ' s use of " green " energy resources and allow edison customers to opt for cheaper direct - access energy service .the assembly didn ' t vote on the keeley bill friday , because hertzberg is considering forming a working group with the senate and the administration to " iron out the bills ' differences , " said hertzberg ' s spokesman paul hefner .davis said he wanted any working group to continue working over the summer break to devise a compromise by the aug . 15 deadline ." i don ' t want people to go out fishing for 30 days and come back and worry about it on aug . 20 because i know we ' re going to have reapportionment and other major issues to deal with in that last month , " the governor said .on the net :read the bills , ab 82 xx by keeley and sb 78 xx by polanco , at http : / / www . leginfo . ca . govread the governor ' s memorandum of understanding at

Subject: thoughts on technologyit is a little bit funny and a little bit sad watching the technology group try to get buyoff from louise and the business units on 2002 budgets . it is unbelievable that we can ' t get a project - based capital and expense budget for next year where someone like me can say i signed up for these 5 projects and willing to do them at such and such a cost . if the project costs more then i ' m not interested . while there is definitely room for improvement on the technology side , the commercial side has room for improvement as well .we had a very useful ees risk / wholesale risk technology meeting on friday . it was clear from that meeting that commercial , technology , and operations are not on the same page . east wholesale and west wholesale commercial aren ' t on the same page . ees commercial and ena commercial aren ' t on the same page . ees marketing and ees risk may not be on the same page . anthony and beth aren ' t on the same page . sally beck ' s organization is organized wholesale vs retail while ( at least on the power side ) the commercial and technology groups are heading towards organized along commodity lines .for fear of sounding too dramatic . . . the success of ees as well as wholesale services deals is a function of our technology and back office . without it we fail . the cost numbers are huge . it is a critical point of competitive advantage .it was amazing , we had a room full of talented people at this meeting on friday ; i believe what was standing between us and a successful technology development effort was organization . we are completely disorganized right now . there are very few specs that are currently written to support next year ' s projects . we have a completely inefficient , decentralized process for working through this stuff .i have some thoughts that i ' d like to share . it cuts across wholesale and retail . i think that we need a lead from commercial , technology , and operations for power ( and probably gas ) . i think the commercial person needs to drive the process and ultimately sign off on spending money for projects . i think that we need one technologist in charge of all power systems . i think that we need to look at everyone we have and choose the right person - - not necessarily the people who are currently leading this effort , although anthony and beth could be leading contenders . we need sally beck to look at her organization and make sure that it is aligned for maximum likelihood of success .the goal of this is not to micromanage each business unit ' s technology needs . it is to coordinate and optimize across groups . we have to make sure that we don ' t spend money in wholesale and retail and then develop incompatible systems .how do you guys want to talk through this ?

Subject: project inga recap / follow uprecap :the california project ' s ( " ace " ) fundamental position , coal generation in gas - on - margin market , is attractive on the fundamentals . ace ' s economics through a range of scenarios ( forward srac rates ) also appears attractive . however , due to the uncertainty in the california market , the deal team needs to resolve issues 1 . and 2 . ( at minimum ) before returning for final approval :timing risk : price and execute a 30 - 40 day call on " deal purchase " to keep competition at bay and buy time to work through market and partner risks .market risk : approach so cal edison and cdwr to structure and close a deal that enables ace to sell directly to cdwr ( or other credit worthy counter party for term , or at least until so cal edison starts honouring its qf contract with ace on a current pay basis .partner risk : approach constellation , co - managing partner in ace , to price / structure buyout of their interest in ace or a swap of pennsylvania for california project positions .follow up :the following actions have been taken :timing risk : greg blair initiated discussions last night with the seller ' s advisor , chase , to purchase an option to close in late april . we expect to hear back from ahlstrom ( seller ) today or friday . deal team will notify office of chairman when we discover ahlstrom ' s bottom line on option premium , expiration date and strike price .market risk & partner risk : greg blair and terry donovan put messages into millenium ( ace manager ) and constellation to get things moving on cdwr / edison deal and to see if we can structure a deal to get control of ace . substantive progress on either front will be reported .regards ,mike j miller

Subject: pg & e plan of reorganizationall :attached is a csfb synopsis of pg & e ' s plan of reorganization ( por ) . the key to successful consummation of the por is being able to move pg & e ' s retained generating assets ( primarily diablo canyon nuclear and the hydro ) from cpuc jurisdiction to ferc jurisdiction , under a disaggregation of the assets ( genco , disco , electransco & gastransco ) . the current cost of service generation rate at cpuc for these assets is approximately 2 . 8 cents per kwh . the por envisions a ppa between genco and disco at approximately 4 . 5 cents per kwh . the ferc would use a concept of benchmarking in approving this rate . benchmarking is a market rate comparison .while the por contemplates no rate increase from the existing average generation rate of 9 . 4 cents per kwh , with the now lower cdwr revenue requirement , the cpuc could possibly reduce rates in the interim . this could give the cpuc cover in alleging that the por is a rate increase . the critical legal point in the por is preemption in the bankruptcy court . under this doctrine , federal law can preempt state law , as part of the por . judge montali will have to approve this move . while pg & e envisions por consummation by 12 / 31 / 02 , given the precedent setting nature of this move and what will surely be an adverse cpuc attitude , the process could drag on longer as it is fully adjudicated through the appeals process .on our claims , the por at consumation would pay 60 cents cash and 40 cents in reconstituted notes designed to trade at par . interest would be paid from por confirmation to consummation . our $ 403 million in px credits claims are listed as contested . the challenges listed are based on : 1 ) the rate freeze having ended and 2 ) the effect of ferc price mitigation on the px clearing price .regards ,michael

" although pjm also conducted a " best practices " analysis , the other isos and ny tos do not agree with pjm ' s determinations of what practices from their isos are " best practices . "the judge acknowledges that support for option 3 - m ( the pjm plan ) " far outstrips " the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support . however , the judge believes that the pjm option assumes the pjm platform can work in new york and new england , even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in new york and new england than in pjm . the judge states that " impatience , haste and greed " should not be permitted to drive the rto process " at the expense of sound policy " and that optimal rto benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to " exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint . " see report , page 18 .governancethe other substantive issues we have discussed are governance : interim governance , final governance , board make - up and stakeholder process . the judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead , he discusses the pros and cons of each option . here again , the judge strongly urges the commission to provide guidance to the participants on the commission ' s preferred governance approach . the judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures .pjm has stated that in order to meet its deadline of november 2003 ( and certainly earlier ) , pjm has to be in control of the implementation of the new rto . pjm proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing isos : 5 from pjm , 3 from new york , and 2 from new england . the board elects a voting ceo ( assumed to be phil harris if the pjm proposal wins ) .ny iso , new england iso , ny psc , ny tos and new england tos , along with other entities ( primarily those who are afraid to cross new york psc ) all support equal representation on the new board . one proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with a non - voting ceo . the other proposal would have 3 board members from each iso with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders .we support the pjm board make - up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single northeast rto and energy market based on the pjm system .post mediationthe judge in his report recommends that the commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge .the judge urges the commission to not accept comments from participants , but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment . we are working on two sets of comments now , one on our own and one in conjunction with the one rto coalition . we will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared .although we are disappointed that the judge did not endorse the pjm proposal , we still believe that the commission is intent on implementing a single northeast rto as soon as possible and that the pjm proposal provides a well - reasoned ( even conservative ) approach to reaching that goal . therefore , even though the judge sided with new york , we are hopeful that the commission will stick to its guns and go with the pjm proposal .please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the report .sarah , dan , howard and tom

" enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the fastow - related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed . the company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership - related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions .the sec inquiry came from the agency ' s fort worth , texas , regional office . according to a person familiar with the matter , this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the sec ' s enforcement arm , as opposed to its corporate - finance section . the participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law . however , enforcement - branch inquiries often don ' t produce any allegations of wrongdoing . it also appears that the sec hasn ' t yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation , which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated . the sec declined to comment .certainly , there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions , which contributed to a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of enron ' s efforts to unwind the deals . mr . fastow , who has declined repeated interview requests , resigned from the partnerships , known as ljm cayman lp and ljm 2 co - investment lp , in late july in the face of rising conflict - of - interest concerns by wall street analysts and major company investors .since then , internal partnership documents have shown that mr . fastow and perhaps a handful of enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the ljm 2 , the larger of the two partnerships .mr . fastow ' s partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside enron , according to people familiar with the matter . for instance , these people say , sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999 , enron treasurer jeffrey mcmahon went to company president jeffrey skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by mr . fastow ' s activities . mr . skilling didn ' t share mr . mcmahon ' s concern , these people say , and mr . mcmahon requested and received reassignment to another post .mr . skilling resigned as enron president and chief executive in mid - august , citing personal reasons and the fall in enron ' s stock price , which peaked at about $ 90 a share last year . mr . mcmahon and mr . skilling haven ' t responded to repeated interview requests .investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in enron ' s dealings with other related entities . in some cases , enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so - called double trigger provisions occur .for example , last july enron helped create the marlin water trust ii , which sold $ 915 million in notes that are due july 15 , 2003 . however , enron can be considered in default , in advance of that date , if its stock price falls below $ 34 . 13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either moody ' s investors service or standard & poor ' s .currently , enron debt is still investment - grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category . last week , moody ' s put enron on review for a possible downgrade . however , observers believe that even if moody ' s lowers enron ' s rating , the company will still be investment - grade .copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .october 23 , 2001where did the value go at enron ?by floyd norrisnew york timeswhat really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen ?wall street has been puzzling over that since enron ( news / quotesenior columnistthestreet . com10 / 22 / 2001 07 : 15 am edturl :enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors , but its decision to reduce equity by $ 1 . 2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market .the action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner . more important , investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect enron ' s balance sheet , profits and earnings guidance .enron didn ' t provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction .enron doesn ' t include a balance sheet in its earnings release , so the equity decrease couldn ' t be spotted in numbers supplied tuesday . and even though enron did break out $ 1 billion in earnings charges in its release , the company didn ' t feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text .instead , the public first heard about it on a tuesday conference call . ceo kenneth lay said enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so - called " structured finance arrangement . " the wall street journal later reported that enron ' s counter - party in this transaction was an investment partnership called ljm 2 co - investment , which has set up and run by enron ' s finance chief , andrew fastow .this is what lay said on the tuesday call about the equity move : " in connection with the early termination , shareholders ' equity will be reduced approximately $ 1 . 2 billion , with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding . " according to the journal , lay then said wednesday on another call that enron had repurchased 55 million shares .enron ' s supporters count lay ' s mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish , because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future .but there are two possible problems with this theory .first , enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make $ 2 . 15 per share in operating earnings next year . critically , the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the 55 million shares or not . if the forecast does assume the exclusion of the 55 million shares , the company should have upped its 2002 per - share earnings forecast by around 6 % , since that ' s the amount by which the share count will be reduced . enron needs to say what share count it ' s using in its guidance .second , it ' s almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded , casting a certain amount of doubt on lay ' s assertion that the share count will come down .why question the ceo ? well , in its 2000 annual report , enron included some disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with ljm 2 . it reads : " at december 31 , 2000 , enron had derivative instruments . . . on 54 . 8 million shares of enron common stock . " the derivative instruments appear to be types of options , or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices .but these derivatives - linked shares don ' t show up where they should in the annual report : in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts . the line item in this table that shows options - related shares totals only 43 million shares , which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion . therefore , that number almost certainly doesn ' t include the 55 million ljm 2 - related shares . the fact is , at least some of the 55 million derivatives - linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options . that ' s because the ljm 2 derivatives appear to have been " in the money " , or profitable for the holders . typically , all in - the - money options - based stock has to be included in the diluted share count . and these ljm 2 derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of 2000 . back then , enron stock was trading around $ 80 , way above the average $ 68 level at which these derivatives made money for ljm 2 .maybe these weren ' t simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count . that ' s what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply . alternatively , the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure , though it ' s hard think where .presumably , investors will get a full explanation in enron ' s quarterly financial results filing with the securities and exchange commission , due by the middle of november .

Subject: re : amendment to im ii ppatodd and louise ,with respect to no . 1 below , i will check with mike curry to get his view on " contract intent " .with respect to no . 2 and no . 3 , the answer is absolutely " no " as they are material changes to the contract that have significant value issues . since i personally requested these changes to the original contract ( in the negotiation process ) , i know what the contract intent was and continues to be .if aep is still the equity buyer , they have complete control over the " grid curtailment " and associated termination risk in item no . 2 since they are the transmission owning utility in the region .the total epmi ppa ( as of 9 / 17 cob ) value is currently $ 18 . 5 million . my estimate for ppa value erosion for amendments no . 2 and no . 3 is $ 8 - 10 million . obviously , the $ erosion value is somewhat subjective , however , the transmission risk / grid curtailment risk on this project is significant and the termination event for grid curtailment is essential to mitigate what could be substantial downside for epmi . the reason i had mike ensure this provision was in the current ppa was to shift some of that risk back to enron wind and now enron wind is trying to push it to the project lenders ( who also don ' t want the risk ) .- - - - - original message - - - - -from : lindholm , tod a .sent : mon 9 / 17 / 2001 5 : 54 pmto : presto , kevin m . ; curry , mike ; lamb , john ; payne , michaelcc : murphy , harlan ; kitchen , louisesubject : re : amendment to im ii ppakevin ,ewc requires three clarifications to the ppa in order to get the project financed and sold . all previously requested amendments proposed by the equity purchaser have been dropped , and ewc will take the resulting pricing reduction .i want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are . these clarifications conform to the original deal and are not changes to the deal .1 . banking provisions . ewc and epmi agreed that energy and renewable energy credits ( " recs " ) produced by the indian mesa ii wind generating facility in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would , on a cumulative basis , offset any deficiencies of energy and recs in subsequent years . section 4 . 04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carryover mechanism which was contemplated by the parties . ( this section originally provided for the carryover , but in an effort to simplify the language , the aggregate carryover concept was clouded . ) both the project lenders and the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified . there has never been a disagreement between epmi and ewc on the intention of the carryover banking provisions . epmi ' s most recent refusal to make this clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal2 . grid curtailment ewc and epmi drafted the contract with specific provisions relating to termination resulting from grid curtailment , section 5 . 04 . there is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covered under the termination provision relating to force majeure under section 5 . 02 . this inconsistency is the problem . neither ewc nor epmi were to pay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment . the proposed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of the ppa be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would not give rise to termination payments . this clarification is consistent with the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal .3 . epmi credit support . epmi ' s obligations under the ppa are guaranteed by enron . the indian mesa ii ppa permits epmi to assign the ppa to certain affiliates without consent of the seller . any assignment by epmi would not relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract , and the enron guarantee would remain in place . however , the project lenders have required clarification that the enron guarantee would either explicitly remain in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good as enron corp ' s credit quality . the project lender ' s have also requested that the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any substitute ppa used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be with a party that had a credit quality similar to enron corp ' s , since that is the credit that is supporting the indian mesa ii ppa . this will not affect the value of the contract to a third party since enron bears this obligation unless released by the project .under the dispute resolution provisions of the ppa we could certainly pursue declaratory relief under arbitration . our sense is that this does nothing but ensure delay .from an enron perspective :the sale of the equity and the financing of the non - recourse debt on the indian mesa ii project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrounding the ambiguities in the ppawhile the debt financing for the indian mesa i project is in place ( different offtaker ) the proposed equity sale to aep is linked to the sale of the indian mesa ii project .if enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within the next month , enron will likely end up with approximately $ 153 m less cash at year end than it counted on in its plan , in addition to any decrease in planned earningsthe after - tax return to enron in a " hold " situation is 0 % , due to enron being in the alternative minimum tax position , i . e . it cannot use the tax benefits .it was clear in the discussions with the city of san antonio that these clarifications would have had no affect on value .tod- - - - - original message - - - - -from : presto , kevin m .sent : saturday , september 15 , 2001 2 : 41 pmto : curry , mike ;

' s finances is likely drawing closer to answering questions about complex partnerships that wiped out more than $ 1 billion in shareholder value and almost $ 600 million in profits .sec officials don ' t discuss their works in progress , but already the results are becoming clear .the company admitted that massive accounting errors over the past four years led it to overstate its profits and understate its debts , an admission that no doubt saved the company from some sec penalties , say observers .and the company has gradually distanced itself from its former chief financial officer - considered the architect behind some of the deals - and indicated that other employees were personally involved in the partnerships without its knowledge . but the culpability of enron ' s current or former employees , if any , won ' t be clear for some time .on oct . 17 , the day after enron reported an unexpected third - quarter loss , the sec began asking enron questions about two off - balance - sheet partnerships , called ljml and ljm 2 . they were formed to help the company grow without adding additional debt or diluting stock valuations , and were also used to help hedge against the risks in some of enron ' s newer lines of business .former cfo andy fastow formed the partnerships with the approval of the company ' s board of directors , attorneys and auditors . his dual role as cfo and managing partner of those two partnerships had the appearance of a conflict of interest , even though enron insisted that measures were taken to prevent any illegal or unethical behavior .the sec ' s role in looking at the partnerships isn ' t to prevent company executives from having conflicts of interest in their dealings , however , but rather to make sure the companies fully disclose those conflicts or any situations that may appear to be conflicts , said john coates , a professor at harvard law school ." so although they have a role in determining that all the information in enron ' s proxy was correct and that all transactions were reported , they were not responsible for determining whether or not the transactions were done on fair terms , " coates said .item 404 of sec regulation s - k requires companies to disclose any transactions where executive officers personally benefit by $ 60 , 000 or more . that disclosure should include their direct and indirect interests in the deal , the amount of money or assets they receive through it and other information .as in all rules , however , there are certain exceptions .if an executive ' s compensation from a deal is less than 10 percent of the value of the overall transaction , they may not need to disclose all of those details , coates said . that stipulation could possible give enron cover for not having previously disclosed the $ 30 million fastow earned through the partnerships ." but there are times when the companies may have followed the letter of the rules and the sec still pushes them to fully disclose the details , " he said .whether or not enron needed to disclose previously the investments or profits that a number of other employees made in some of the partnerships is also hard to discern .the company said this week that in addition to fastow , five other employees invested in the deals . two of those employees - ben glisan , a managing director and treasurer of enron corp . , and kristina mordaunt , a managing director and general counsel of an enron division - were terminated by enron this week . the other employees , including fastow and executives michael kopper , kathy lynn and anne yeager , no longer work for enron .the company didn ' t mention how much those individuals invested or how much benefit , if any , they reaped from the deals . some of the employees may not even fall under the disclosure rule since it doesn ' t give a clear definition of what positions are " executive officers . "the company has gradually distanced itself from fastow and the partnerships since the problems arose . shortly after the earnings report last month lay said he and the board stood by fastow , but a day later replaced him .on oct . 31 , the day enron said the sec had upgraded its review of the finances from a simple inquiry to a formal investigation , the company announced that its board of directors had created a special investigation committee of its own . a company spokeswoman stressed that the committee had the power to take disciplinary action against any enron employee , officer or director who it determines " improperly participated in the transactions . "in its sec filing that outlined the partnerships on thursday , the company said it was aware of the partnerships but required that certain safeguards be put in place and that the transactions be approved and reviewed regularly ." whether these controls and procedures were properly implemented is a subject of the special committee ' s investigation , " the statement said .at a friday news conference , lay said the board was aware of the formation of one of the partnerships but that he was not aware that glisan and mordaunt were investing in the partnerships . lay deflected many of the questions regarding the investigation , saying a conference call would be held next week .shareholders have lined up behind lawsuits against the company , the partnerships , and even the company ' s law firm , vinson & elkins ." disclosure cases and state corporate law cases are all but assured in situations like this , " coates said .

" ( three months later ) seattle is still growing and still known as a good place to live . "what is more important in terms of houston ' s corporate image and its image in general , smith said , is " whether it ' s easy to get around and get to work and how smoothly a businessman can get to tokyo or london . "smith believes houstonians should be more concerned about other local problems such as getting the city ' s pollution problem " under control in a rational way . " if houston continues to be known as one of the most polluted cities in america , smith said , " that will continue to haunt us . "the demise of enron is " certainly not good news , nor was compaq good news , " said steve klineberg , a rice university professor of sociology .the two companies enhanced the city ' s image and stature , klineberg said , in that they signified that houston was moving out of a 20 th - century oil - based economy into a 21 st - century economy based on information and technology .in terms of image , the enron news is more damaging within the business community than to the perception of houston by the world at large , said steve currall , associate professor of management psychology and statistics at the jesse h . jones graduate school of management at rice university ." enron has very little business - to - consumer activity , and for the average person on the street " it doesn ' t mean much , he said .but it is significant to the business community , currall said . enron has been a fortune 10 company and consistently ranked as one of the most innovative companies in america . " and i think the struggles of enron ( have ) a negative impact " in the business community , he said ." houston has benefited from a company like enron , which has made the city a world headquarters for energy trading , " currall said . " it made us a hub for the development of financial management innovations ." it ' s part of the reason why enron and dynegy resonate with the wall street gang . they say , ` that trading stuff down there is cool . ' it ' s the convergence of highly sophisticated finance and the energy industry . "currall said he is delighted that dynegy is enron ' s " suitor " because it keeps the people and operations in houston ." that ' s great news for houston , " he said .others agreed that the presence of dynegy in houston will soften the blow .enron being bought by dynegy , another houston firm , is " like a couple of cousins getting together , " said barry silverman , a marketing and management consultant ." in a sense , there is no loss for houston , " said david crossley , president of the gulf coast institute , a nonprofit group that promotes quality - of - life issues in the area ." who would have thought that a company in houston was capable of buying enron ? " crossley said . it makes dynegy a bigger company and , he said , creates a certain mystique about houston since both cutting - edge businesses are here .david morris , the managing partner of the houston office of heidrick & struggles , an executive recruiting firm , believes that houston has been unfairly stereotyped as having a " gunslinger " style of business environment , and he is concerned that " what ' s perceived as a gunslinging type of accounting at enron will be underscored once again . "but what should really be emphasized , morris said , is houston ' s creativity ." that enron took an old - line industry of gas transmission and re - created it into the marketing of gas and trading of gas and hedging of the price for gas - creating different value streams in the same industry - and did it before the rest of the world could grasp it all is pretty amazing , and none of that is going away , " he said .that point was echoed by don henderson , vice president and managing director of hyatt regency , houston , and the recent chairman of the greater houston convention and visitors bureau ." when you think of new york , you think of the stock market , " he said , " and when you think of chicago , you think of agribusiness ." and more and more when you think of houston , it ' s energy as a commodity . and it ' s only going to be stronger with all the mergers and acquisitions because the business of trading energy as a commodity is only going to grow . "henderson maintained that houston is still the envy of much of the country .houston has always been one of the continuously booming economies , he said , and " has bounced back quicker and stronger than any region . "to offer an example of the city ' s resilience and appeal , henderson noted that hewlett - packard chief executive officer carly fiorina recently stated that the work force of compaq ' s houston campus might increase in size in part because of the city ' s business - friendly environment compared to what she described as a less friendly business climate in california .silverman maintained that the recent experiences of various local businesses " won ' t hurt our image at all . "" in this global economy , you often see companies changing names and headquarters , " he said . " it ' s like a monopoly game ." i bet if i asked 100 people where microsoft is headquartered , 50 of them couldn ' t tell me .

" the appropriateness of that time diminishes the further it gets from the present .neither enron officials nor investors need to wait for the committee ' s report to conclude that letting executives profit on the side from the partnerships while sticking stockholders with the liabilities was inappropriate . for the sake of enron , its stockholders and the citizens of houston , who depend on enron ' s contribution to the economy and the civic life of the city , that arrangement must not be repeated .much of enron ' s problems stem from straightforward but imprudent or ill - timed investments : a power plant in india , broadband capacity not needed in a collapsing telecommunications market , and a doomed venture into the water business - azurix corp .those losses might have been survivable , had enron not denied its own transactions the transparency it sought for global energy markets .copyright ? 2000 dow jones financial deskderegulation not derailed by california ' s meltdown power : though many energy firms were scarred in the state ' s free - market stumble , analysts say they are likely to rebound .nancy rivera brookstimes staff writer11 / 11 / 2001los angeles timeshome editionc - 1copyright 2001 / the times mirror companybranded as lawless cowboys by california politicians and consumer advocates , energy merchants rode skyrocketing electricity and natural gas prices to new stock highs during the worst of california ' s energy crisis .but in recent months these energy companies - - names such as duke , dynegy , reliant , aes , mirant , williams and el paso corp . - - have seen their fortunes dim as california ' s electricity meltdown has slowed the pace of deregulation nationwide , power prices have tumbled and the economy has faltered .even power plant owners and energy trading operations that have maintained healthy earnings growth have watched their stock performance fade .and then there ' s the enron effect .enron corp . , cast as the heavy by california politicians , has suffered the biggest fall of all and has helped to drag down stocks of other energy producers and traders .enron ' s woes appear to be a special case in that they flow less from its energy businesses than from a loss of investor confidence in the company ' s complex and shadowy financial structure , with a resulting cash crunch .nonetheless , enron ' s detractors are crowing at the rapid decline of the truest believer in electricity deregulation , the movement to take businesses controlled for decades by monopoly utilities and throw open the generation , trading and retail sale of electricity to new competitors .but just as enron is not dead , neither is electricity deregulation , energy experts contend . though several states have delayed their deregulation plans and some major corporate players are tempering their enthusiasm , other states and corporations press ahead .it ' s a tough new world for energy companies that will bring profit opportunities for some and acquisitions of low - priced players , analysts say . enron , once the most brash of the energy peddlers , has agreed to be acquired by archrival dynegy inc . in a $ 7 . 7 - billion stock deal .yet when the economy and power prices improve , energy companies will see their prospects gleam again , analysts say ." deregulation is a train that ' s not going to be derailed . it may be delayed , but it ' s coming , " said jon kyle cartwright , senior energy analyst with brokerage firm raymond james & associates ." when the economy rebounds , we ' re going to see higher energy prices again , " cartwright said . " that means that the guys who sell power , the guys who manufacture power - - they ' re going to have very bright futures . "less than a year ago , when energy prices were headed for record territory in california and a winter of electricity shortages plagued the state , the favorite whipping boys of gov . gray davis and other politicians were such energy sellers as enron , aes corp . , dynegy , duke energy corp . , reliant energy inc . , mirant corp . , williams cos . and el paso corp .all are energy companies that own power plants in california or sell electricity or natural gas in the state at prices deemed by state officials to be higher than those a truly competitive market would have produced . the energy companies have denied that they overcharged californians , and federal regulators investigating the matter have so far ordered only limited refunds of electricity revenues .nonetheless , southern california edison co . and pacific gas & electric co . lost so much money paying for electricity - - costs they could not pass on to customers because of a rate freeze - - that they became insolvent . pg management has been tight - lipped about the purpose and holdings of the investment vehicles .takeover rumors swirled last week around enron before dynegy announced the deal friday , underscoring predictions of general industry consolidation because of low stock prices .some firms thriving , but not their stockssome companies are still going strong , although their stocks remain depressed .that includes companies on the receiving end of potshots from california ' s politicians and utility regulators such as duke energy , dynegy , mirant , nrg corp . and williams , as well as san jose - based calpine corp . , which was repeatedly praised by davis for playing a constructive role during the crisis .calpine , for instance , said third - quarter profit and revenue doubled because the electricity producer increased sales by adding power plants . and yet its stock is down 55 % from a 52 - week high of $ 58 reached in march ." these are the energy merchants that seem to have the best grasp on the market and on risk management , " said chris ellinghaus , power and natural gas analyst with williams capital in new york . many of these companies are diversified geographically and by the fuel they use to generate electricity and had locked in favorable contracts that protected them when power prices fell this summer , he said .abn amro utility analyst paul patterson said investors have turned away from these companies , even the healthy ones , because the business " isn ' t as exciting as it used to be . "" people go on earnings momentum . it ' s kind of like having your dessert first , " patterson said . " once the best is over , you lose your appetite . "one company trying to adapt to deregulation ' s devolution in california is commonwealth energy corp . , which has survived a run - in with the california public utilities commission and the suspension in california of direct access , commonwealth ' s primary business of selling electricity directly to consumers and businesses .commonwealth energy was one of the more than 300 companies that flocked to california to sell retail electricity to the customers of southern california edison , pg & e and san diego gas ; photographer : robert gauthier / los angeles times ; graphic : landscape for electricity , los angeles times ; ; graphic : losing wattage , los angeles times ;copyright ? 2000 dow jones on friday they were worth a tenth of that .the market felt there was good reason to push the stock to those heights . here was a company that had , for many years , appeared to make all the right moves . as the group transformed itself from a dull utility into an exciting mix of energy trading , communications and services , it seemed never to put a foot wrong . " you had such an outstanding and arrogant company , " said roger hamilton , a senior fund manager at john hancock , " they were the giant . everything in the energy industry touched enron . "the company even managed to persuade investors its convoluted management structure , which some believe is the root cause of its demise , was a positive thing . " you can ' t kiss the ass of 24 people , " said former enron chairman jeffrey skilling . " and together those 24 people are more likely to have the interests of the shareholders at heart than any one person . "unfortunately , behind the scenes , all hell was breaking loose . the last couple of months have given the market a long , embarrassing string of revelations about the company it once cherished . the company has $ 13 bn of outstanding debt , and has found its access to funds extremely limited . two weeks ago , as a measure of its desperation , enron had to secure a rescue loan against its 25 , 000 - mile network of gas pipelines . along the way , details of the group ' s botched expansion into india have made for supremely depressing reflections on management . crowning the whole sorry tale , and driving the shares down 80 per cent , was the opening last month of a securities and exchange commission probe into the accounting for some of enron ' s partnerships . last week came the sacking of the group ' s treasurer and corporate lawyer , and a revision of earnings for the last four years to the tune of half - a - billion dollars .despite it all , dynergy ' s bid could be the steal of the century . until all its troubles are out in the open , enron may be just a little too grimy for many potential buyers . but even the most bearish analysts can see there are rich pickings from the old enron empire . dynergy ' s big problem is snapping them up before the big boys , including chevron or shell , poach the good stuff .leo lewiscopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .usa : wall street takes aim at accounting tricks .by deepa babington11 / 11 / 2001reuters english news service( c ) reuters limited 2001 .new york , nov 11 ( reuters ) - wall street is starting to refuse to bite the bait on dubious earnings numbers highlighted by corporations in press releases .companies tout profit figures , frequently called pro forma results , that strip out unseemly one - time charges and expenses at record levels - more than $ 200 billion this year alone . investors , analysts , and accountants are revolting , and pressure is building to do away with the medley of different profit numbers or at least cut down on it .standard & poor ' s , a major compiler of earnings and other financial data , now will treat restructuring charges , stock option expenses , and write - downs from ongoing operations as part of a company ' s operating earnings - items that many companies exclude from their version of operating earnings ." in the past , s & p would take a company ' s special charges at their word , " said s & p analyst robert friedman , who was involved in the project . " but now we ' re going to say , ' hey , wait a minute . ' "the decision underscores the momentum building on wall street to scrutinize corporate accounting . one recent high - profile victim of this movement was enron corp . the energy trading company faced a crisis in investor confidence after it became clear it had boosted profits and racked up debt through complex financial transactions known as off - balance sheet deals .the deals , which were structured so they wouldn ' t show up on enron ' s balance sheet , caused enron to chop almost $ 600 million off earnings for the last four years . the once - mighty company lost $ 20 billion in market value , and on friday agreed to be bought by smaller rival dynegy inc .investors are scared of such stock market casualties . that ' s partly why they want to crack down on pro - forma numbers , which often present a much rosier picture of a company ' s performance because they exclude a whole bevy of costs that drag down the bottom line ." hopefully , this will put pressure on companies to think twice when they put out their financials , " said friedman .tech companies , in particular , conveniently have stripped out everything from inventory write - downs to severance costs from their bottom - line figures and pressured analysts to do the same with their earnings estimates .mobile phone maker motorola inc . , for example , reported a third - quarter pro forma loss of $ 153 million early last month . after including charges for investment impairments , cost reduction activities and additional reserves for its financing of a turkish cellular operator , however , the company posted a whopping $ 1 . 4 billion loss .a motorola spokesman was not available for comment .the practice has also made it difficult for analysts and investors to compare the results of one company against its peers as each comes up with its own ideas of what should be included in pro forma earnings ." there are so many variants of pro forma that it can cloud comparisons , " said david zion , an accounting analyst at bear stearns .the proliferation of these reports has also caught the attention of the nation ' s accounting rule makers , even though they don ' t have the authority to police press releases .the financial accounting standards board ( fasb ) two weeks ago said it is pressing ahead with a project that will look at how some closely watched items such as pension fund income should be classified and presented in financial statements .corporate america was not enthused by the idea and several corporations wrote to the accounting body urging it not to go ahead with the plan , said the project ' s senior manager , ronald bossio .but fund managers and investors are applauding .in a survey of 223 portfolio managers by capital markets firm broadgate consultants , nine out of 10 stock pickers said companies need to improve how they report results . fasb needs to come up with one key indicator of financial performance , and companies should abide by it , they basically said .if the accounting rule - making body accepted ebitda , or earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization , as a key measure , companies ought to calculate it in a consistent manner and display it as a separate item on their statements , almost all managers agreed ." i think that pro forma thing is just a way to get around generally accepted accounting principles , " said debra mcneill , a portfolio manager at fremont investment advisors . " i think there needs to be some guidelines to be set out on pro forma numbers , but it does not necessarily need to be banned .copyright ? 2000 dow jones instead , they extend a slew of tax breaks , routinely approved by congress , which are about to expire .at the white house , spokesman ari fleischer said the senate bill contained " too much spending and not enough stimulus . " he lambasted the $ 220 million in the bill for bison meat , eggplant , cauliflower and pumpkin growers - in essence , a government subsidy for commodities that have " experienced low prices during the 2000 or 2001 crop years . " thirty - four commodities would qualify .but senate finance committee chairman max baucus , d - mont . , said aid for the ailing agricultural sector is an appropriate element of a recovery plan ." when our national economy declines , rural areas are often among the areas that are hit the hardest and that recover slowest , " baucus said .another industry that could benefit from the senate bill is the motion picture industry . like the house bill , the senate bill allows businesses more quickly to write off their investments in assets whose value depreciates over a number of years . but unlike the house legislation , the senate bill includes a provision specifying that films are a depreciable asset qualifying for the tax break .copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .

Subject: re : uk gas late deal input and deal booking errors - ol . 1 m hitsorry to hear about this one .i have some observations to make from my reading ( and re - reading ) of theaccount :1 it looks like the old " undue influence " problem again . it seems someattempts were made by operations to follow up , but nothing happened .we tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we don ' thave any way to protect them if they do - there is still the fear that ifthey upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career . and thatis because twice a year , at the prc , that can happen . this incident showssome of these attributes .for the operations process to be effective there has to be ( and be seen tobe ) little significant influence from commercial groups over the ranking ofthe operations staff .2 whoever signed off the new deal lists in the dpr should be asked to confirmthe basis on which they signed it .3 why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers ? brokerage is inthe p & l and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerageis at the agreed rate , they should simply pay the brokerage .4 two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable - it should be done sameday . i would not have waited for the traders to do it , but i would want toknow why it took them so long .5 given that these ( short ) trades were absent from the portfolio during ahighly volatile period of rising prices , i would wonder about motivation inaddressing the position during this time . essentially , if it had been correctwe would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we did .i would pursue explanations to points 2 , 4 and 5 .dpfernley dyson @ ect06 / 12 / 2000 02 : 41 amto : james new / lon / ect @ ectcc : richard lewis / lon / ect @ ect , mike jordan / lon / ect @ ect , robertyeo / lon / ect @ ect , gail hill / lon / ect @ ect , ian sloman / lon / ect @ ect , steve wyoung / lon / ect @ ect , david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , brent aprice / hou / ect @ ectsubject : re : uk gas late deal input and deal booking errors - ol . 1 m hitjames ,thanks for the note . as described , this is an intolerable situation . i agreeyour action points , but we need timelines and quantitative measures ofcompliance / improvement - please could you provide a weekly update on thisarea specifically and until we are satisfied that things are as they shouldbe .on a more general note - let ' s ensure that the ' global standards ' address thelapses in timely action / follow - up identified here so that we can monitorperformance across the business .fernleyjames new09 / 06 / 2000 10 : 03to : richard lewis / lon / ect @ ect , fernley dyson / lon / ect @ ect , mikejordan / lon / ect @ ectcc : robert yeo / lon / ect @ ect , gail hill / lon / ect @ ect , ian sloman / lon / ect @ ectsubject : uk gas late deal input and deal booking errors - ol . 1 m hiton the 7 th of june gas risk management became aware that two ' late ' trades hadbeen entered into the gas trader ' s ' blue book ' which were both being bookedsignificantly late and had a material negative p & l impact ( negative ol . 1 m ) .the ' late ' deals were done on the 3 rd of february ( marcello romano ) and the30 th of march ( haakon olafson ) and were both forward starting sells forperiods in 2003 - 2004 .background1 ) input errorsfor some considerable time we have been concerned with the number of dealinput errors that have been occurring in the gas area with the mostsignificant number coming form the uk gas traders . numerous errors have beenfound by documentation and risk management over the accuracy and timelinessof entering deals into the ' blue book ' ( the gas traders are currently theonly traders in europe who do not enter their own trades into the valuationsystem - there is currently a big push to change this which has the supportof john sherriff with a deadline date of 31 july ) .in the past documentation and gas risk management have repeatedly highlightedbooking errors to the gas traders but the error rate has not fallen . a log ofall deal input errors has been formally maintained since the beginning of maywhich highlights an error rate of 12 % - 15 % of non eol trades . this has beendiscussed with richard lewis and corrective action is expected .2 ) deal booking and reconciliation process ( non eol trades )deals are initially written into the ' blue book ' by the gas traders when thedeal is done . this book is photocopied several times a day and the deals arethe manually input into gasdesk by documentation on the same day .faxed broker statements are received ( usually ) by documentation the next dayand these are reconciled to gasdesk with errors and amendments made bydocumentation liasing with the traders as necessary . at this time brokerswere faxing one statement per trade ( relevant later ) .3 ) new deal sign offas part of the daily dpr process a separate new deal sheet is prepared and issigned off by the traders to formally agree the new deals done on the day andthe implied origination p invoice received before 15 march as settlementsstarted checking it .

Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please treat with discretion .executive summary :? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives . politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of out - of - state generators? june lst " kill clause " for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional plan? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper administration involvement? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout deal1 . ferc falloutthe ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation .it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan .2 . something less than effective price capsfrom davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws :? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west . non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to california .? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling .? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion .? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc .3 . proposal " kill clause " adds to the political dilemma for davisthe ferc proposal includes a " kill clause " that says the caps will be withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines blaming him for letting the " bush price caps plan " collapse .4 . growing fiscal risk in californiasources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for power .the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about 90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals . the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to california .the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months .5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & emeanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts , since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline .6 delays likely in new qf generationthe qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated .7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout planharvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a " non - bypassable " charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not stand a likely constitutional challenge .8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contractsthe issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis . even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged , creating an even further delay .

" the question might comeup as to whether there was fair consideration given for theamount of these bonuses and whether they were reasonableunder the circumstances . "if creditors can convince the court that the employees wereoverpaid - or that the payments were made to keep money outof creditors ' hands , a much more difficult argument toprove - then the judge can void the payments and order themoney returned , said lynn lopucki , a law professor at theuniversity of california at los angeles .to tamp down such disputes , a company typically will file arequest , as part of its bankruptcy filing , to make paymentsto certain employees , and not proceed with the paymentsuntil receiving a judge ' s approval , mr . lopucki said .yesterday , mark palmer , an enron spokesman , defended thepayments as necessary " in order to protect and maintain thevalue of the estate . " such payments " are done in everybankruptcy , " he said , adding that the payments were made toemployees " at all levels of the organization . "employees who lost their jobs after enron filed forbankruptcy protection on sunday were told they may receiveno more than $ 4 , 500 in severance pay . they also were toldto petition the bankruptcy court to cash in unused vacationdays .in another legal slap at enron , a shareholder lawsuit filedlate tuesday accused 29 enron officers and directors ofengaging in " massive insider trading " and making " false andmisleading " statements about the company ' s financialperformance while selling about $ 1 . 1 billion worth of stockover the last three years .an enron spokesman declined to comment on the suit , whichwas filed by amalgamated bank , which is known to be anactivist shareholder .how to advertise- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -for information on advertising in e - mail newslettersor other creative advertising opportunities with thenew york times on the web , please contact alysonracer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online mediakit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfofor general information about nytimes . com , write tohelp @ nytimes . com .copyright 2001 the new york times company

Subject: working paper list & etcdear vince :i have put together a list of finance working papers ( some of which i brought to the interview last wednesday ) which i have written since 1995 mostly in support of my work but also ( at least initially ) as a learning tool . several of them , however , do contain innovations .i have asked ms . de claris to forward a copy to you .as i expressed to you earlier i am particularly interested in enron credit swaps trading platform and the business opportunities that it will spawn .i also think that there are tremendous opportunities to be explored in the secondary mortgage maket in the us . i do not know if enron has considered or is active in this market . this would be an area that i am also very interested and in which i think much better can be done than most of the players in the street .the question in my mind ( hopefully not prematurely ) is : if there is interest here would enron consider letting me put together this business ?i look forward to hearing from you soon .best regardsjoao
Subject: aga forecast for 7 / 21 is 42vince & stinson ,the number comes out from the time series model is 42 , compared with mike ' s61 .last year ' s number ( true ) was 41 ( 7 / 23 / 99 ) , and 26 ( 7 / 30 / 99 ) . therefore thecurve is down - sloping dramatically .let us see what happen tomorrow .zimin
Subject: budget # ' shere is my first cut at taking the existing budget numbers to a desk - level . here are the key assumptions behind my cost allocations :direct costs for each group went to that group .gas ops was allocated to houston gas .power ops was allocated to east and west power based on commercial headcount .most other costs were allocated to gas , east power , west power , canada , ooc based on commercial headcount .there are a hundred ways you could do this exercise , i ' m not saying that this is the right way , but at least i was able to break the costs down .i then calculated an ebit by desk , funded a bonus pool , paid bonuses to all the non - commercial people , and figured out what a bonus pool would look like by desk based on the proforma values . i am not necessarily saying that this is the way that we should do it , but i think that it is one way to view the world upon which we can make whatever changes / adjustments we deem necessary . here are my initial conclusions / reactions :the proforma produces bonuses for commercial employees equal to roughly 6 % of their gross margin .this number is high relative to the 1 - 2 % we are used to , but considerably lower than the 8 % to 12 % that appears to be available in the market .our costs are way too high . for every dollar of direct commercial expenses there are four dollars of allocations . that just seems way out of hand .this model sells with lower costs . with current costs , i have a hard time convincing people in portland that this looks good relative to people ' s alternatives .i think that we need to have a lot of discussions next week on how this new organization would be managed . i don ' t see why we couldn ' t debate , if not nail down , a bunch of things next week . for example :how do we allocate var to the best performing traders and the market that offers the best opportunity at the time ?do we need to incent desk heads based on netco earnings while compensate traders based on desk earnings ?how will we carve up the bonus pool ? what are our choices ? what gets the var to the right places and properly incents teamwork ?how do we best manage costs ? how do we send appropriate cost signals for sunk costs ? for variable costs ?we need a very strong , professional , operations manager who is steeped in cost accounting , efficiency , quality control , and leadership . there is a science to operations management that i haven ' t seen applied at enron . for example , what does it cost us to schedule a mw - average and marginal ? what does it cost us to run a book ? what does it cost us to settle transactions ?what package are we going to be able to offer to incent people to stay ? when can we start talking about it ? who should we discuss this with ?what does our management team look like ? is it three people ? five people ? ten people ?i want to make this thing work . my clear first choice for 2002 is to be on this team . i want to be as contructive and helpful as possible in achieving this end . i can ' t commit unequivically ( sp ? ) until we sort out all of the numbers , i feel like i can sell this to the portland team , and i know what comp looks like for me and the key people in portland . i feel like some adjustments to the proforma and a clear understanding of 2002 comp will probably get us there .when do you want me in houston ( for a visit - not to move ) ?tim

( the possible exceptions are the temptations to overeat and watch too much football . )thanksgiving is a holiday designated by men and women - a day specifically set aside to enjoy friends and family and to ponder our good fortune . as most of you know , the first thanksgiving was held in new england - a bountiful feast during which the american forefathers joined with native americans to celebrate a good harvest . this celebration drew a line under a dreadful year of enormous suffering - inadequate food supplies , disease and death .this is a very difficult time for all of us at enron . i want to take a few minutes of your time to share with you some of my thoughts - for even now , it is important to count our blessings and recall some of the many things for which we can be thankful . i am thankful for the way all of you have pulled together each day , doing your best to make the most of a really tough situation . i am moved by the kind words many of you have shared with me . i have been impressed by your willingness to look forward , stay the course , and maintain your sense of humor . your loyalty and commitment have sustained me during some of our darkest moments . i am grateful for friends , family , and the opportunity to live and work in a free and open society . mostly , i am so very proud of you - your talents , your flexibility , your work ethic , your willingness to hang in there when things seem to be spinning out of control .thanks for constantly reminding me how lucky i am to be working with you .john sherriff

Subject: enrononline budgeting methodas you each have heard over the past few days , enrononline is currently looking at a new methodology for charging the business units for services in 2002 . we intend to move away from an allocation mindset into one where services ( in the form of products , transactions , and development ) are charged on a usage basis , allowing the business units to scale and develop their markets in a more cost responsive way . my assistant will be contacting your offices to schedule 30 minutes with each of you on friday , oct 19 th to go over the proposed plan and discuss its impact on next year ' s budget . i am confident that this process will yield a method that accurately reflects the cost of enrononline and allows each of you to make sound financial decisions about your plans to use enrononline in 2002 .please don ' t hesitate to call me before friday with questions , and i look forward to meeting with you .brad richter

Subject: re : capacity posting procedurespursuant to our meeting , i was to check the posting timelines to see if we could make the 1 day category , include 5 months or less rather than less than 5 months . based on a recent decision ( march 16 , 2001 ) in columbia gas transmission co , i think we can . in columbia , the commission approved columbia ' s proposal to establish an interactive auction process in which firm capacity available for less than one year would be posted for an initial one hour period from 7 : 00 am to 8 : 00 a . m . capacity offered for one year or more would be subject to an initial posting period of 5 days . this indicates movement by the commission to much shorter posting periods for capacity available for less than one year . i think we can modify our procedures to include up to 5 months in the 1 day posting category . however , we may want to consider combining the 3 day category and 1 day category into one 1 day category for capacity offered for less than one year . in addition , for capacity offered for one year or more , columbia will advertise a proposed offer on its ebb one day prior to the five - day posting of the capacity . ( this supports a special posting in advance . ) although it is good to have these internal procedures , what is important to the commission is that pipeline tariffs set forth specific procedures regarding the availability of capacity .the columbia order also gave guidance on when a pipeline has to accept a bid for max rates . columbia proposed that it not be required to sell capacity to shippers bidding the maximum rate for a term of less than 12 months until one day prior to the commencement of gas flow detailed in the auction package . the commission rejected this in favor of the industrials ' proposal : beginning 30 days before the capacity is available for service , columbia must accept bids at the max rate for a term of five months to less than 12 months . beginning seven days before the capacity is available , columbia must accept maximum rate bids for terms of more than one month to less tha 5 months . columbia must accept maximum rate bids for a term of one month or less one day before gas flows .thanks , maria- - - - - original message - - - - -from : hass , glensent : wednesday , may 30 , 2001 4 : 32 pmto : harris , steven ; miller , mary kay ; fossum , drew ; dornan , dari ; pavlou , maria ; pryor , tony ; donoho , lindy ; watson , kimberly ; darveaux , mary ; fawcett , jeffery ; lokay , michelle ; lindberg , lorraine ; lohman , tk ; kirk , steve ; paladino , ranellesubject : capacity posting proceduresattached for your review is a redlined draft of tw ' s capacity posting procedure including changes suggested at our meeting yesterday . one remaining item is to decide whether capacity available for " less than 5 months " or " 5 months or less " will be designated as 1 day postings . please review and advise if you have any additional comments . thanks .gh>

Subject: fw : special prayer request- - - - - original message - - - - -from : celestedeo @ aol . comsent : tuesday , april 11 , 2000 1 : 21 pmsubject : special prayer requesthi ,i am coming to you with a very special prayer request . we have some goodfriends here in nashville , mark and melanie burress and their one year oldbaby gracie , who have recently received some devastating news . mark wasdiagnosed in december with leukemia . his is normally a very slow spreadingform of the disease but unfortunately his is spreading extremely fast . healso has a rare dna type and only about 12 people on the bone marrow donorlist ( out of 4 . 5 million ) were possible matches and all have since beenelimnated . we held a bone marrow drive in his behalf at church this pastweekend and over 1200 people came to donate . this amazed the people runningthe drive because they said they normally get a few hundred at the most .if a donor is not found by june his chances are very , very slim to live tojuly . he has chosen to have his bone marrow transplant in houston at theanderson hospital so i am asking if there is anyone in houston who knows ofastrong , supportive congregation near the hospital that they may attend ( whenpossible ) while they are there , that would be greatly appreciated . if adonor is located , they say the transplant procedure is very difficult and hewon ' t be able to have any contact with his baby for several months due tohisimmune system being weakened . as you can imagine , this would put his wifeina severe state of limbo , having to be primary caregiver to someone who isincapacitated and a baby without the two being able to be together .it is difficult to watch someone with so much to give and so much to liveforto be facing such a hard fight . please keep his family in your prayers andiknow if there is a miracle with marks ' name on it , god will provide it .if you could please pass this on to the chi sigs / regina list , every littleprayer they get will be appreciated .thank you !celeste ( sasser ) ortega

placed sources in the government , the company has informed themadhav godbole panel that it would be meeting on may 11 . earlier reports hadindicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on may 5 .according to sources , enron would be meeting the panel with representativesof its lenders and shareholders . the godbole committee , that studied thecurrent power purchase agreement , has called for cancellation of the presenttariff structure , renegotiation of the lng and shipping contract , removal ofdollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned , debtrestructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the powerpurchase agreement . these suggestions , it seems , may not be acceptable toenron . the maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the godbolecommittee to renegotiate . the committee has been given a month  , s time torenegotiate on behalf of the state government with dpc for a new ppa .the committee has opined that since the lng facility of 5 mmpta is far inexcess of what is required by the plant ( only 2 . 1 mmpta of which 1 . 8 mmpta ison take or pay ) , it should be separated into a distinct facility whosecapital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge , not as take or pay .it should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the powergeneration . using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high plf .instead , the surplus gas can be sold to other players like petronet or enron  ,s own metgas .  & it is important to distribute the cost over the entirecapacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant ,  8 says thecommittee . similarly , it has been suggested that enron could lease out theharbour facilities as a common facility to other lng importers . on the lngcontract negotiated by enron for long - term supplies , it has said that sincethe lng market has witnessed great changes , particularly as far as prices areconcerned , the power company should take advantage of spot buys andrenegotiate the contract accordingly .- -

member godbolepanel . though the dpc spokesperson was reluctant to give a confirmation , a keymantralaya official told the times of india that the team had expressedwillingness for talks with the experts committee in a bid to end theimbroglio .enron ' s response is viewed as a welcome development to amicably resolve thecontroversy which had been raging for the last few weeks , with the board ofdirectors of enron authorising its india md k wade cline to serve atermination notice to mseb . the state government , on its part , too adopted aconfrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc fordefaulting on power supply . however , the sudden change of heart by the enronmanagement is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders ledby industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) which had recently opposed themove to pull out of the project . this was in contradiction to the stand takenby the foreign lenders of the dpc who were in favour of slamming the brakeson disbursement of funds to dpc . the congress -

an order resolving the amoco complaint over elpaso ' s capacity allocation . in the order , the commission finds that elpaso ' s allocation of delivery point capacity at topock is unjust &unreasonable . the commission directs el paso to assign primary point rightsto its shippers using a one - time assignment process outlined in the order .if elections for primary point capacity exceed available space , el paso willpro rate the space and allow shippers to select other primary points in aniterative fashion until all shippers have primary point rights equal to theirfirm capacity rights . chairman hoecker said this case illustrates the factthat overbooking pipeline capacity is even more problematic that theoverbooking of airline capacity .

Subject: re : vmac transactionlouise ,the overall idea seems logical as a method to leverage collateral received on profitable deals .one additional benefit would be if this allowed us to use other securities as collateral that a counterparty would not accept ( i ' m not sure what kind of other securities we have ) .i also think that for enrononline to continue it ' s success that in the medium term it will need some form of margining / collateral as part of the system , but you will have a better sense for weither this would be an issue in the us given a healthy enron - it is an issue in europe and with banks regardless .issues :big systems issue for implementing a same day mark to market and liquidity calculation accross all products on enrononline . therefore , i assume this would be rolled out only on the highest volume products . this will increase the cost of each transaction .liquidity algorithm will be hard for counterparties to swallow as they will not want to post incremental capital .contract issue - do you make the collateral part of all enrononline deals as if you don ' t it will be difficult to differentiate between counterparties .existing exposures - how do we assign the collateral rights on existing net exposures to vmac . this will likely be a logistical issue as you must have many counterparties but if the high value ones are few it could be doable , but why would the counterparty agree as he should already have our collateral ( e . g . lc ) or this may require him posting more .timing - this might be implemented by end of ql , but is unlikely to give you immediate benefit .cost - am not sure what us brokerage is but this seems to be equivalent to 40 % of brokerage as it is being paid on both sides . does this destroy margins .threshold - would there be a credit threshold as if not this would be very onnerous on all parties .quick win :effectively you are using collateral received to post collateral through a sleave . would it not be possible to negotiate this directly with a counterparty given a select few who require high postings currently . in either case you would have to negotiate adjustment to collateral but if it can be done without a sleave but with a bigger haircut then you would avoid the delay in setting this up wholesale . i do not know if this is legally possible .i ' ll call to discuss and if you want me to do more detailed work let me know .m- - - - - original message - - - - -from : kitchen , louisesent : 27 november 2001 16 : 04to : romano , marcellosubject : fw : vmac transactioni ' ll get you working- - - - - original message - - - - -from : eichmann , marcsent : wednesday , november 21 , 2001 2 : 51 pmto : kitchen , louise ; lavorato , johncc : richter , bradsubject : vmac transactionlouise and john :here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with vmac ( virtual markets assurance corporation ) - fsa ( financial securities assurance ) . fsa is an aaa rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal .here are the deal highlights :fsa would wrap enron ' s credit exposure as follows :1 ) in case of default fsa would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions .2 ) in case enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to vmac . fsa would pay the counterparties with the 100 % collateral previously posted by enron and managed on a day to day basis .fsa has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to enron based on its net collateral position ( ~ $ 1 . 3 billion as of today ) and the net mark to market position ( ~ $ 1 . 4 billion to date ) . haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant .fsa - vmac would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions . under the current structure the only risk fsa - vmac is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts .please find enclosed the following :1 ) transaction structure : describes the payment logic in case of default2 ) terms and conditions : describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract3 ) collateral haircuts : describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to fsa to guarantee our net mark to market position ( if out of the money )4 ) fsa snapshot5 ) fsa rating : aaa qualification of fsa by moody ' splease feel free to contact me or brad richter to clarify any doubts with respect to this ,marc eichmannwork 713 345 - 8422 , cell 713 870 - 2696manager transaction developmentenrononline llc> > > > >

Subject: california senate formally withdraws contempt actions against enronyesterday , we reached agreement with the senate regarding the terms and conditions under which the company would provide information to senator dunn ' s committee investigating wholesale price spikes .in return , dunn agreed to have is committee formally withdraw all contempt actions against enron .this morning , dunn convened his committee and the committee formally withdrew the contempt actions .a story related to the deal is attached .if you have any questions , just let me know .best ,jeff- - - - - original message - - - - -from : denne , karensent : friday , september 14 , 2001 11 : 02 amto : kean , steven j . ; sanders , richard b . ; dasovich , jeff ; palmer , mark a . ( pr ) ; schmidt , ann m .subject : contempt articlesenron agrees to provide files , averts senate contempt findingby emily bazarbee capitol bureau( published sept . 14 , 2001 )state lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against enron corp . on thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately .the last - minute wrangling between enron and a special senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929 .following hours of closed - door meetings , enron signed an agreement in the early evening , allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full senate and the possibility of stiff fines .under the deal , enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over ." it took too long to bring this to resolution , " said state sen . joe dunn , d - santa ana , who chairs the committee . " i can ' t help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt . "as part of the deal , however , enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in july asking the court to intervene on its behalf , said spokeswoman karen denne . she said the company is still considering its options ." we ' re pleased they ' ve agreed to withdraw the contempt charges , " denne said .enron - - and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them - - had been found in contempt in late june after it refused to turn over documents , violating subpoenas that the committee issued on june 11 .the subpoenas called for documents of all kinds , including those with specific details - - prices , quantities and capacity - - of the companies ' transactions in the state ' s wholesale electricity market .enron officials balked at the request , saying they didn ' t want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets .ultimately , the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the senate .thursday morning , the senate rules committee met to consider the committee ' s contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full senate , along with suggested punishments in the form of fines .after an hour of finger - pointing and confusing allegations , senate president pro tem john burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences .at 6 p . m . , enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed .dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies .in addition , the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities , including the sacramento municipal utility district . smud was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents .the bee ' s emily bazar can be reached at ( 916 ) 326 -

- enron corp . signed a confidentiality agreement late thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a senate investigation into the california electricity market .the compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations .at stake for enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines .the senate rules committee on thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full senate to hold enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents .while delaying the decision , senate leader john burton , d - san francisco , ordered attorneys from the legislative counsel of california , a senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets ." let ' s hope cooler minds prevail , " said rules committee member sen . ross johnson , r - irvine , as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting .the contempt proceedings , for now , have been dropped , said sen . joe dunn , d - santa ana , who chairs the senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market .enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late thursday .the state senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation ' s two largest public - employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the legislature .the legislative counsel of california is recommending the action ." it is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the california legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of california , " said dunn , who asked for the counsel ' s review and recommendation .enron agrees to turn over documents to senate investigatorsby jennifer colemanassociated pressseptember 13 , 2001sacramento - enron corp . agreed thursday to release company documents to a senate committee investigating possible price manipulation , ending the committee ' s quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena .the senate rules committee heard arguments from enron and the senate select committee to investigate price manipulation of the wholesale energy market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt .in june , the select committee subpoenaed enron files as part of its investigation into record - high prices in the state ' s wholesale electricity market . enron sued to quash the subpoena , a motion a judge rejected .the judge agreed , however , that enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information .sen . joe dunn , d - santa ana , chairman of the select committee , said late thursday that enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators . with that agreement , dunn said , the committee would withdraw a report that recommended enron be found in contempt .he said he expects documents to be transferred immediately .dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents , and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee , it was in contempt .he asked sen . john burton , d - san francisco , chairman of the rules committee , to approve fines against enron for each day they didn ' t comply with the subpoena . the daily fines would start at $ 1 , 000 , doubling each day for 10 days . then the company would be fined $ 1 million a day .enron lawyer michael kirby said the company had put 49 , 000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in sacramento so committee investigators could review them .but dennis murphy , a lawyer for the select committee , said enron didn ' t tell investigators where the depository was located . the committee discovered the address in documents filed by enron for the court case , he said ." we ' ve been trying to get into the depository for a week . they have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there , " he said .kirby disputed that , and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents . the two parties haven ' t met since the judge ordered the protective order , and kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order ' s details .dunn said the law requires enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order .sen . ross johnson , r - irvine , said dunn ' s push to have enron found in contempt " smacks at this point of enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court . "a contempt report on reliant energy has also been sent to the senate . a contempt finding against mirant corp . was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in sacramento for the committee ' s investigators .if the full senate imposes sanctions against reliant or enron , it will be the first time since 1929 , when the senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state .

( nyse : dyn ) beat expectations in the third quarter , reporting that its earnings rose to $ 286 million , or 85 cents per diluted share , from $ 177 million , or 55 cents per diluted share , for the same period in 2000 . this represented a 22 - percent increase from 3 q 2000 and boosted the company ' s 2001 earnings estimate . dynegy has a market capitalization of $ 14 . 5 billion . its stock is currently trading at about $ 43 down from a 52 - week high of $ 59 , although it is important to note that for year - end 2000 the company ' s stock was one of the top performers among standard dynegy , on the other hand , not only believes in the ownership of physical assets , but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry .let ' s look at the companies separately . we ' ll discuss enron first since it is the older of the two . enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define , but a close approximation is that enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers . the participation and success in commodity markets , according to enron , does not necessitate ownership of physical assets . in fact , the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business . rather , enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence , in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues .as an example , enron bought portland general ( which owns 2 , 000 mw of generation and 41 , 600 kilometers of electric t & d lines ) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the west coast power markets . when competition fizzled in that region , enron put portland general back on the sales block ( a sale of portland general to northwest natural is pending at this writing ) . likewise in europe , where it is one of the most prominent trading companies , enron has disposed of generation assets such as sutton bridge in england and , unlike other u . s . competitors , has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as germany and italy . according to its most recent 10 k report filed with the securities and exchange commission , enron owns or controls 2 , 015 mw of generating capacity ( including joint ownerships ) , which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector .dynegy ' s approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from enron ' s . in the words of ceo chuck watson , " dynegy ' s long - term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets , which supports earnings sustainability . " ever since going public in 1995 , dynegy has been on an acquisition binge , with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability . dynegy presently owns or controls about 27 , 000 mw of generating capacity in the united states , 26 gas - processing plants and 14 , 000 miles of pipelines , which are located in geographically competitive areas . the company ' s goal is to own or control 70 , 000 mw , or 10 percent of the u . s . market , within the next five years . sometimes , dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as nrg energy , but just as often it has purchased assets independently . most notably , when dynegy acquired illinova in early 2000 , the purchase doubled dynegy ' s generating capacity . dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in europe , where it is presently planning to purchase natural - gas storage facilities in england . dynegy executives have argued that natural - gas storage is the best way to back up a natural - gas trading operation . there ' s no question that the approach is working . out of the $ 286 million that dynegy reported in the third quarter , $ 263 million of it came from the company ' s main wholesale business .the issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between enron and dynegy , and its significance should not be overlooked . it is not difficult to make a case that supports dynegy ' s approach . owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price . in other words , by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells , a trader such as dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region , how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur . in addition , in markets that are short on infrastructure , it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region . by the same token , those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators , and possible insight to spreads ( the difference between various energy prices ) . in fact , dynegy ' s ceo watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price , and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist . this may be more difficult for a company such as enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids . dynegy ' s strategy of acquiring both natural - gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities .on the other side of this argument , a case could be made that enron ' s approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility . certainly , by investing less in power generation facilities , enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like dynegy . under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop , a company such as enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset - laden company because enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility . asset - heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility . as the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom - line results , this could be seen as a potential concern for investors . further , some would argue that enron ' s approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility . what enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio .consequently , the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the " great debate " among power traders . however , although dynegy ' s overall performance in the third quarter was better than enron ' s , that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of dynegy ' s strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities . keep in mind that enron ' s 3 q losses resulted primarily from non - recurring charges related to its non - core businesses ( broadband and water in particular ) . without these charges , enron ' s core wholesale trading business continues to perform well . this is a point that ceo ken lay has been quick to reiterate to investors . " our 26 - percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural - gas pipelines , " lay said . " the continued excellent prospects in these businesses and enron ' s leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook . "moreover , perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets , the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between dynegy and enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies ' approach to developing new lines of business . telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point . enron , which prides itself as usually gaining a first - strike advantage , plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies . under the leadership of then - ceo jeffrey skilling , enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative . now lay admits that the company " could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital " and that enron " spent too much too soon " in this sector . nevertheless , enron recorded an $ 80 - million non - recurring write - down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $ 40 million a quarter .dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to enron . dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector , but in the third quarter took a $ 15 - million loss in its broadband business compared to the $ 80 - million loss that enron reported . however , dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities ( electricity and natural gas ) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business .it is also important to note that enron gained the first - strike advantage when it developed enrononline , an electronic trading exchange . in fact , enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space , well ahead of its competitors . dynegy later followed this trend with creating dynegydirect . the two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards , but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors . the latest available information indicates that enrononline has recorded transactions that exceed $ 590 in notional value . since its inception in november 2000 , dynegydirect has recorded $ 33 billion in notional transactions .at this juncture , dynegy and enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting . enron , which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors , is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the securities and exchange commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by enron ' s cfo . to my recollection , no one has ever accused dynegy of not providing a balance sheet , and thus the company ' s status with investors is arguably more solid . as i don ' t expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon , my projection is that ( at least in the near term ) , we will continue to see a wide disparity in wall street performance between dynegy and enron . that is not to say that anyone should count enron out of the game . as noted , the company ' s core business of wholesale business remains strong , but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non - core businesses . that doesn ' t mean enron is down permanently , but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former ceo jeffrey skilling believed were advantageous .in many ways , the comparison between dynegy and enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable . i am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy . the race between the two is far from over , although dynegy is taking the lead at this point , based on its more methodical approach . what will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies ._ _ _ _ _correction statement to 10 / 23 issuealert on european trading :according to a news report from reuters , the u . s . -

Subject: hpl sale - energy operations task listi talked with anne koehler in legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from energy operations prior to the effective sale of hpl . anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term " protocol " into these discussions . to clarify , according to anne , the " protocol " is not anticipated to be a formal legal document . instead , anne envisions simply e : mails or memos between enron and aep with regard to any sharing of information , agreements on processes to be followed in the transition , etc . operational details to be decided between enron and aep have been handled exactly in that manner to date , with e : mails being sent from bob ball ( enron ) to steve jackson ( aep ) .only critical changes to the purchase and sale agreement will be formally documented . bob hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original purchase and sale agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of may . he has worked with enron ' s treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with sandi braband in legal to document this change to the purchase and sale agreement as an amendment to that agreement . as of today , legal has completed revisions to that amendment and anne koehler is sending it to mary perkins in enron ' s treasury group for her review . upon mary ' s review , anne will forward the amendment to aep for their review before final signatures .we devised this week a new format for incorporating the aep - hpl transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you . this new format incorporates the various memos and e : mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues . items that only require actions by enron will be our " to do " list . each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress . those items that fall under the aep list or which appear in both the enron and aep list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to aep and / or their agreement via the e : mails or memos as suggested by ann koehler . i believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written " protocol " . we will also update you weekly on the status of those e : mails and / or memos between ourselves and aep .i understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the hpl sale . to provide clarity for these update meetings , may i suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches :1 ) brian and i hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that brian has a full understanding of operational transition items and their status , or2 ) i attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you .please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week .

Subject: commoditylogic . commike ,further to our conversation , here are some of the things i thought of whilespeaking with tom gros . there are definitely some challenges we have toovercome to make the hub idea within commoditylogic . com as successful asenrononline rather than have it turn out like sitara .i won ' t repeat thoughts about how we split cl from enron , but let ' s putourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as apotential solution . well , that ' s an easy decision , somebody else is doing thehard work , and not charging us very much for it . so sign - up , but don ' t relyon anything until we see everything working .handling counterparties not using the systemthe challenge here is that the final solution world with overybody using thehub is wonderful , but until everybody is using the hub , we have to keep otherprocedures and systems going , which stretches resources , development , itsupport and user . this was why we decided to delay getting bolero - theconcept is wonderful , but the value to any user is very dependent on everyoneelse one trades with using the system . this is classic chicken and egg . tomhas a vision of cl providing the staff to handle this . this is taking uscloser to an outsource - to - andersen - consulting model which is certainlyachievable , although not quite such an easy sell .how much resource is leftthe latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people , whoare therefore not available for keeping everything else going and movingonwards . how about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to cl , andthen review what is left in the remaining environment . does it mean we holdoff doing anything ? if we do then increasing volume means that we might endup incurring costs for massive numbers of people ! we should go throughcosting for " what happens if we completely stop development of x project ? " .if that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something elsecomes along then it may be cheaper than developing , but i hope in most casesit is not !start small to prove concepte . g . first application in april 2001 only covers 20 fieldsthis is excellent , and we needn ' t shout it too loud to investors in cl , butfor our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will beyears before we can switch off many internal systems .we might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3years out ?include european aspects from the beginningthis really isn ' t very difficult so long as one has some long - on - common - senseeuropeans ( not just brits ) involved in both specification and developmentfrom the beginning , but an as example of how not to do it , look at enpowerwhich took a year to allow just for currencies etc !80 - 20 rule for types of transactioneol has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first .once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting ( dtl ) and risk( risktrac ? ) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on stp ,and yet - to - become - vanilla products on explicitly different , manualapproaches . until that time , we have a strong desire to include as manydifferent prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system , whichmakes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly ( think ofcertain deals in power 99 which are approximations of the actual deals , andmanually tweaked every so often )testingtom ' s first thought is that we could leverage initial users ( who would notpay ) to do much of the testing .eol clearly got its testing done , but other experience shows that in order tohave anything which saves time one really does need to do all the differentphases - component , system , integration , end - to - end , and then user - acceptance .eol saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use manyexternal users early in the process . it did have massiveresource - commandability and so obtained input from many traders . do thesupport functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide thesame sort of user attention ? given how often i hear " short people " , thatstrikes me as something which in london would require significant additionalresource , even after mg is absorbed .what else did you come up with ?richard

( chewco got its name , says one person familiar with the matter , from the character chewbacca in the " star wars " movies , where jedi warriors also roamed . ) chewco bought from enron the jedi interest formerly held by calpers , according to documents and interviews . it couldn ' t be determined what the terms of that transaction were . however , the fact that chewco shows up as a debtor to jedi in the texas state filing suggests that money for the purchase was borrowed from jedi itself .the available information on the chain of transactions raises questions about how separate jedi and chewco really were from enron and whether jedi ' s assets and liabilities should have been folded into the company ' s financial statements .in a march 2000 sec filing , enron makes a brief reference to its new jedi partner , which enron doesn ' t identify but presumably is chewco . the filing said " an officer of enron has invested in the limited partner of jedi and from time to time acts as agent on behalf of the limited partner ' s management . " while the officer isn ' t named , the description is similar to that given for mr . kopper in relation to chewco in the ljm 2 offering memorandum .in march of this year , enron moved to purchase the balance of jedi that it didn ' t already own . in an sec filing earlier this year , enron said it acquired for $ 35 million " the limited partner ' s interests " in jedi . again , the partner wasn ' t named , but presumably was chewco .enron consolidated jedi ' s assets and liabilities into the company . the sec filing said jedi ' s holdings included 12 million shares of enron stock . enron said it also paid off about $ 620 million of jedi " third - party debt .

" we read the disclosure over and over and over again , and we just didn ' t understand it - - and we read footnotes for a living . " he says . but at the time , he concedes , " it was just an odd footnote to us . "he started telephoning analysts at wall street firms to determine what aspects of the bulls ' case he was missing . what he heard excited him further . part of the bullishness focused on enron ' s strategy of trading broadband - network capacity . mr . chanos , who already had placed bearish bets on some telecommunications bandwidth providers , was convinced that the industry already suffered from overcapacity and that the situation would only get worse . his conclusion : if enron " couldn ' t see the looming train wreck coming in telecom , what else were they missing ? maybe they weren ' t as infallible in the energy area as people had thought . "another warning signal was insider stock sales through the second half of 2000 , he says . that sat awkwardly with the common refrain from wall street analysts that investors had to just trust management given the difficulty of analyzing how earnings were derived . the company didn ' t immediately comment on the sales on friday ." you look for patterns in my business , " says mr . chanos . " the fact that this was a ` trust me ' story , while management was voting with its feet was another check . while we didn ' t have a smoking gun , we certainly saw a reason to perhaps not trust management at its word that these earnings were what they said they were . "those factors led mr . chanos to begin shorting the stock in late november of last year , when it was fluctuating between $ 65 and $ 80 ; he won ' t provide details . overall , the level of short interest , or short - selling positions not yet closed out , on enron shares jumped 2 . 2 million shares to 7 . 9 million shares for the month through mid december , from the same period in the previous month .as other red flags surfaced , in february mr . chanos and other short sellers significantly ramped up the bearish positions . mr . chanos first discussed his view of enron with those outside the firm that month in miami , where he hosted his annual " bears in hibernation " conference . attendees bring two ideas to present , and one of his was enron .with enron ' s stock trading at $ 72 at that time , or roughly 40 times 2001 ' s per - share earnings estimates , " the market is priced for perfection here , " mr . chanos told the 25 or so attendees , " whereas it looks like things may be anything but . "back in new york , mr . chanos arranged a second round of sessions with bullish analysts . " here ' s our thesis , " he told them . " what are we missing ? "mr . chanos came out of those meetings with a " heightened conviction that we were right . " for one thing , he sensed frustration brewing about the level of trust required with enron .as the spring progressed , mr . chanos became increasingly confident , adding to his short position . on a widely reported conference call in april , jeffrey skilling , then enron ' s chief executive , responded to another short seller ' s criticism that enron hadn ' t provided a balance sheet by calling him an " ah . " for the first time , " i got a sense that the company was now getting tough questions and was not happy about it , " mr . chanos says .for their part , wall street analysts argue that they have limited time and resources for the in - depth research that mr . chanos prefers . many cover dozens of companies . still , some say they have learned lessons from enron ' s fall from grace . salomon smith barney analyst raymond niles , for one , says he will " pursue warning signs relentlessly and go by gut instinct " when he senses a looming problem . says mr . niles , who covers enron : " i think shorts play a very valuable role in the market , reminding us of what can go wrong .

' s independent auditor , arthur andersen llp has the job of making sure the houston energy trader ' s financial statements not only are accurate and complete in all material respects , but also are understandable .now for the really tricky part : understandable to whom ?for andersen , this isn ' t just an academic question . once again , the accounting practices of one of the big five firm ' s most prized clients have come under intense scrutiny from regulators and shareholders . questions could well turn to whether andersen fulfilled its obligation to protect investors ' interests . and an important focus is likely to be whether andersen should have required enron to better explain its dealings with partnerships run by former chief financial officer andrew s . fastow before agreeing to bless the company ' s financial statements .enron revealed last month , in a conference call , that its shareholder equity had fallen by $ 1 . 2 billion during the third quarter as a result of transactions in which a partnership controlled by mr . fastow was at least at times involved , fueling a steep dive in the stock price amid growing concerns about the company ' s financial health . many wall street analysts , including die - hard enron bulls , long have grumbled that parts of enron ' s financial statements are indecipherable ." the heart of disclosure is intelligibility , " says alan bromberg , a professor of securities law at southern methodist university in dallas . " if the people to whom it ' s addressed can ' t understand it , it hasn ' t been adequately disclosed . there ' s clearly a qualitative , as well as a factual , component to disclosure . "under generally accepted accounting principles , the rules for disclosing related - party transactions seem straightforward enough . among other things , companies must describe the " information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements . " but the nation ' s accounting - standard setters never have offered any clear guidance on whether companies ' disclosures should be understandable to a broad audience or merely to financially sophisticated individuals with specialized training . and even sophisticated investors are prone to being stumped now and then .to be sure , the adequacy of a company ' s related - party disclosures can be determined only when all the information about the transactions is out in the open . for its part , enron - - which is hardly the only large energy company with complex partnership dealings - - maintains its off - balance - sheet transactions were legal and properly disclosed . " they comply with reporting requirements , " says enron spokeswoman karen denne , adding that andersen was aware of the transactions and reviewed them . " to the extent that an investor doesn ' t understand them , they are able to ask questions . " and in the end , she notes , investors who didn ' t understand the transactions didn ' t have to buy enron stock .enron ' s disclosure practices stand out , however , because they have been a source of complaints for so long . even some top - flight accounting professors say they can ' t make heads or tails of the company ' s transactions with mr . fastow or enron ' s motives for entering them . if they can ' t figure them out , it raises the question of whether any outsider could .one thing is certain : the stakes for andersen could be high . since enron ' s disclosure of the reduction in shareholder equity , its stock has plunged 67 % to $ 11 . 30 as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading friday - - a drop that wipes $ 20 billion off the company ' s market value and potentially exposing enron and andersen to massive shareholder liability . already , enron ' s dealings with the partnerships are the subject of a formal investigation by the securities and exchange commission . that creates the possibility that andersen itself could become a focus of the probe at some point , should regulators find enron ' s accounting and disclosure practices deficient . meanwhile , the law firm for a special committee set up by enron ' s board has hired accounting firm deloitte & touche llp to help review the partnerships ' activities .an andersen spokesman , david tabolt , says the firm " will continue to cooperate with [ enron ' s ] special committee , lawyers and accounting advisers " and " will also cooperate with other official investigations as requested . " so far , he says , the sec hasn ' t told andersen it is a subject of the enron probe . beyond that , he declines to comment on enron , citing client - confidentiality obligations .how murky are the related - party disclosures in enron ' s audited financial statements ? here is a summary of a section in enron ' s 2000 year - end financial statements describing certain transactions with the fastow - operated partnerships . the company said it transferred assets valued at $ 1 . 2 billion , including $ 150 million in notes payable , 3 . 7 million restricted enron shares and the right to receive as many as 18 million enron common shares in march 2003 , subject to certain conditions . it also transferred to the partnerships other assets valued at $ 309 million , including a $ 50 million note payable and " an investment in an entity that indirectly holds warrants convertible into common stock of an enron equity method investee . "in return , enron said it received " economic interests in the entities , " $ 309 million in notes receivable and an additional $ 1 . 2 billion in notes receivable as part of a " special distribution . " the disclosure went on to mention a series of purchases by enron of " share - settled options from the entities " on shares of enron common stock .the raw numbers may all be there . but " any objective person would be hard pressed to understand the effects of these disclosures on the financial statements , " says douglas carmichael , an accounting professor at baruch college in new york . " the quality of the disclosure is low , which creates uncertainty about the quality of their accounting . "further , he says , enron ' s explanation of why it entered the transactions " seems to defy imagination . " in the year - end financial statement , enron said the purpose was " to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets , " a category that includes energy assets whose values are prone to wide price fluctuations . yet the disclosure shows that enron chose to use shares and options of its own stock as its chief hedging instrument , even though their price movements wouldn ' t appear to be directly related to the value of the investments enron was trying to hedge ." i don ' t see how that possibly hedges any of enron ' s risks or assets , " mr . carmichael says . indeed , the disclosures have given rise to widespread speculation that enron ' s actual purpose was to use its off - balance - sheet transactions to shift losses off its books to avoid running them through its income statement . asked whether that was enron ' s purpose , ms . denne declines to comment . she says enron stands by its earlier statement that enron was trying to hedge certain investments .to date , andersen hasn ' t been named as a defendant in any of the numerous shareholder lawsuits filed against enron , which paid andersen $ 52 million last year , including $ 25 million in audit fees . enron ' s woes come during a year already filled with embarrassments for andersen . in june , the sec fined andersen and three partners $ 7 million over their audits of waste management inc . ' s financial statements , the largest sec fine ever against an accounting firm . andersen , which neither admitted nor denied the sec ' s fraud allegations , paid $ 75 million in 1998 to settle its portion of a shareholder lawsuit over the houston - based garbage hauler . also this year , without admitting wrongdoing , andersen agreed to pay $ 110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for sunbeam corp .( see related article : " heard on the street : enron short seller detected red flags in regulatory filings " - - wsj nov . 5 , 2001 )copyright ?

or ( 2 ) we put ourselves in a position to be able to post the additional security within the requisite time period . consequently , we do have some time to wait until mid - december provided that ( 2 ) has occurred .as at december 31 , we must post the december 31 amount .atcoexisting amount recommended october 31 amount estimated december 31 amount$ 300 , 000 $ 300 , 000 $ 450 , 000as at october 31 , the financial obligations have been calculated to be $ 300 , 000 and the posted security is $ 300 , 000 ;

( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years .ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 .ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units .other ege supporting data :i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ;j . actual maximum generating capacity ;k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ;l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; andm . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range .with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .the real - world example of allegheny energyallegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy .another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy .offering of energy leader consulting ( elc )ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities .elc transfers its " knowledge " about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process :1 . enron would select one to three target utilities .2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities .3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron .the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered .steven a . mitnickchief executive officerenergy leader consulting4807 41 st street , nwwashington , dc 20016( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice( 202 ) 537 - 0906 faxsmitnick @ energyleader . com

Subject: california 6 / 13executive summary- cpuc rules that socal must pay 15 % of debt to qfs ( approximately $ 50 million )- ruling heightens likelihood of voluntary bankruptcy filing by socal- voluntary filing further heightened by successful ring - fencing by eix parent- bankruptcy judge firm in support for qfsreport1 . socal loses cpuc ruling , but retains appeal optionas you may have seen , bloomberg reported that the cpuc voted 5 - 0 to force socal to make 15 % of its payments owed to alternative energy producers in california . cpuc rules allow 30 days to appeal its rulings , leaving a window open for socal to buy more time .2 . voluntary filing in ?with regard to a socal bankruptcy filing , the key now is how socal ' s boardfeels about progress rather than deadlines with creditors . in other words ,sources believe that a voluntary filing is more likely than an involuntaryfiling . a continuing lack of progress on a bailout and an increase in thenumber of liens filed against socal is more likely to make the socal boardwant to file for bankrutpcy voluntarily . the recent ring - fencing by edisoninternational reflects their need to pay off cross - default risk and to cut tiesin their bank facility between the parent company and lines of credit helds by socal .in and of outself , it does not necessarily signal an imminent filing .3 . involuntary out ?sources indicate that the unsecured financial creditors are notconsidering a filing against socal . this is because the financial creditorsbelieve that they would still be worse off in bankruptcy . sources reportthat in creditor discussions , there has not been talk of the debt holdersnot being paid . " people have talked about screwing the generators andeveryone else , but not the debt holders , " a source commented .the qfs are unlikely to file against socal because they have fairly goodcontracts in place . also , they receive high capacity fees in the summer( these fees vary seasonally and are distinct from generating fees ) . thesecapacity fees are calculated on a rolling , 4 - year basis and will bere - calculated next year . the qfs want this summer included in therecalculation , incentivizing them to keep their contracts in place .4 . montali supporting qfsjudge montali , by his recent rulings , is sending a signal that he isconcerned for the qfs and is sensitive to their hardships . he is trying tohelp them through his rulings . for example , as long as qfs remain on line ,those who petition can receive additional payments from pg & e . over a4 - month period , these payments equal 20 % of the qfs ' pre - petition claims .this provides the qfs incentive to remain connected to pg & e .5 . ge looking to restructure generating capacity financinggeneral electric is reportedly " deeply concerned " about the stability offinancing generating capacity in the us . ( ge has over 70 % of the gasturbine market . ) ge is reportedly trying to keep its margins down and isnot raising its prices due to concerns about instability . sources believethat a very significant percentage of generating capacity financing willhave to be restrucured in five years .

Subject: max :i would like to organize a vitro project review meeting during the next several weeks focusing on the technical risk in the deal and the mitigation measures we taking . the objective of the meeting is to ensure all related enron entities are supportive of the transaction and have had the opportunity to ask questions . this will reduce the chance that we will run into objections down the road on " technical risks " as we begin to ramp up our capital commitments . we had a similar meeting with the electrobolt team in enron s . america , that was very productive and accomplished the above objectives .do you have a project presentation that you ( and / or the lead developer ) could discuss with the above team ? we could do it by phone - or better yet - the next time you are in houston . as many of the technical risk issues are also tied to commercial aspects of the deal we should also cover these areas as well ( e . g . , commercial objectives and obligations driving the technical design and implementation strategy ) .i don ' t mean to be sticking my nose into your deal , other than to ensure that everyone is moving in the same direction so that we can get this implemented successfully .let me know as to your availability ,brian

Subject: alliance updatenote : alliance says they are flowing 40 - 50 % of capacity at this time( 400 - 500 mmbtu / dhitting the chicago market ) . it sounds like they have not yet been able tocommission theaux sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through .some predictorsare saying the delay may get longer .alliance service delay extended to end of novemberalliance pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in - service date willhave to be delayed for the third time , this time until the end of november ,because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting theenormously complex components of the system working in sync . the 1 , 900 - mileproject originally was supposed to be in service oct . 1 ." normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris hasbeen removed from the line , " says alliance ceo norm gish . " however , periodicreductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated therequired integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the auxsable liquid products processing facility near chicago . " a spokesman said thedebris included " bits of foam " that came off equipment used to extractmoisture following hydrostatic testing .the complexity of the alliance pipeline operations also has led someobservers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service . the pipelinehas an immensely complicated system patented by alliance engineers that isdesigned to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1 . 325 bcf / d ofnatural gas from british columbia and northern alberta through 1 , 900 miles ofpipe to the aux sable liquids extraction plant near chicago . the pipelinealso incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allowthe pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown calgary controlroom . alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines : aphysical pipe , a paper pipe and an e - pipe , which brings all aspects of theoperation together around the clock 365 days a year . " it ' s a tremendouslycomplicated system and all the parts are interdependent , for it to work , theyall have to work together . "regardless of the delay , however , alliance already is flowing a large amountof gas into the chicago market . " at this point in our commissioningactivities , the system is flowing at approximately 40 to 50 % of capacity . weexpect to continue increasing the volume of test gas and approaching our firmdelivery capacity of 37 . 5 million cubic meters ( 1 . 325 bcf ) per day prior tothe end of november .

( by taking demand from ourcompetitors ) . i believe , at the moment , there are no bandwidth exchanges thatallow " combinatorial " bids . if we are the first one to do it , we mightimprove our sale channel and gain some market share . ( note : auction - > oneseller and many buyers : exchange - > many sellers and many buyers . )moreover , i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because wecannot sell them anyway . in addition , we ourselves can be a dummy bidder inthe system and bid in the auction . if the current wining bid is too low , wecan just over - bid it and keep the product . this way , we can indirectly put areserve price on the products .let ' s meet sometime in the first week of january .- chonawee

Subject: east powerlouise ,here are some bullet points for the discussions tomorrow :- east power , including generation investments made about $ 50 million in the first half . the greatest contribution came from ben jacoby , about $ 15 million . by the way , i hired ben along with scott healy to acquire sites in 1998 .- all of the traders and structuring , including bernie aucoin told me that john llodra drove both the cmp and nstar deals . total income $ 8 . 5 million .- i believe delainey was correct in saying that ozzie was the brains behind alamac but heather did the execution . total income for the east $ 7 . 5 million .- most of the rest of the deals were done after i came in .- mid market sales have increased . ( 700 % over the first half of 2000 )- this group was in meltdown when i came in ( at least on the origination side ) . i would like to get some credit for stopping the bleeding and starting the rebuilding process in a difficult environment .

Subject: enron announces plans to merge with dynegytoday , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ' ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction .deal terms- - the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1 , 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing .- - chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1 . 5 billion in cash in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas .- - total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares .- - the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year .enron will have immediate access to dynegy ' s $ 1 . 5 billion cash investment in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary .management of newly formed companychuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc . , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo .i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron .management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make - up of the integration team has not yet been determined .the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we cannot rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible .as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company ' s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses .i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions @ enron . com . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at ( 713 ) 853 - 5670 .i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse .and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron .investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement / prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available , because it will contain important information . investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement / prospectus ( when it is available ) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron , without charge , at the sec ' s web site at www . sec . gov . copies of the joint proxy statement / prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement / prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either : investor relations , dynegy inc . , 1000 louisiana , suite 5800 , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 507 - 6400 , fax : ( 713 ) 507 - 6808 ;

Subject: ees / epmi spliti heard dave ' s voicemail . i appreciate his concern . however , i don ' t think that the delineation is easy to do . i am confident that my team knows what we are good at and what we aren ' t good at . if we aren ' t best suited to serve the load , we will act like " one enron " and send the account over to the them . the split should really be driven by the customer ' s needs and which utility they are behind . for example , montana power has a wonderful balancing tariff where the utility looks at the scheduled volume and compares it to the actual volumes and settles directly with the customer for imbalances . we don ' t do any metering , we don ' t do any unique billing , the loads range anywhere from 1 mw to 25 mw . ena is definitely best suited to serve these industrials because commodity price is their top interest . the pugest system is about to open up with a structure that is similar to montana ' s . ena will be very well positioned to serve this load . the same company could have a plant in california . we wouldn ' t serve that load because the expertise needed to manage the ctc risk ( before this thing blew up anyway ) , the challenge of metering and tracking metered volumes on a schedule vs . actual basis , and the load forecasting . the same company could also own gas stations in the west . we have no interest in serving gas stations .i also heard the message attached to dave ' s from scott dann ( sp ? ) . his message did little to open communication between groups . he provided no details on what the issue was in the west with respect to epmi ( ena ) and ees . for us to do this right , ees and ena need to be able to solve problems without involving the office of the chair of each company . i would be happy to work with anyone from ees to resolve who should be covering which accounts .i still can ' t think of a clean way to divide customers . each approach has its problems . each company ( ees and ena ) has its strengths . our strength is commodity pricing and delivering a mw to anywhere on the western grid . their strength is in tariff analysis , energy management , and aggregating loads .for the west , i am confident that chris calger and i can sort out any disputes with ees that are reasonable . we know what we are good at . we have a proven track record with a large number of industrials in the west . i still believe that our customers and shareholders are best served with our favored approach . it will require better communication on the operating level between ees and ena .

Subject: re : out of interestthis is more than you ever wanted to know about catalytica ! if there is any point to regurgitating it , that point would be that this deal didn ' t make a dime for enron , ge got a " gift " ( as i would see it ) of $ 10 million from enron , and catalytica got off scot - free .the december 1999 dash summarized the eight agreements associated with the transactions to " permit the following : ( 1 ) sale and repurchase of the spark spread option ; ( 2 ) funding xonon development in an amount equal to the proceeds of the option sale ; ( 3 ) funding the turbine prepayment at the pastoria project with the same option sale proceeds ; ( 4 ) obtaining the right of first refusal on the first five commercial 7 fas equipped with xonon ; and ( 5 ) purchase of the turbines on an off = balance sheet basis " enhancing the value of the equity investment in catalytica was mentioned as a strategic benefit and potential upside . turbine overpricing was not mentioned in the dash or the risk matrix .when dave added his comments to the may 2000 dash i understood that the $ 10 million cost was intended to be offset by $ 10 million in turbine credits . doing an allocation of the cost seemed logically to mean allocation of the credits once they were recognised . outside of the slim chance that something blew up , the allocated cost would be offset with a subsequently allocated credit , i . e . a wash .from an ena perspective the issue is moot . if the decision is to allocate a portion of the turbine overpricing to the merchant portfolio but none of the credits , that clearly was not accounted for in 1999 or 2000 and certainly was not provided for in the 2001 merchant asset management plan .- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by richard lydecker / corp / enron on 03 / 23 / 2001 11 : 58 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -richard lydecker03 / 23 / 2001 08 : 53 amto : christopher f calger / pdx / ect @ ectcc :subject : re : out of interestchris , thanks for the clarification . pat did confirm with sheila that the turbines were overpriced . . . which seems to mean that enron ended up giving ge a gift of $ 10 million . that seems strange . it also still seems to me that the december 1999 dash did not accurately reflect the deal . unless i missed it , i did not find any reference to turbine overpricing .my understanding of dave ' s comment on the may 2000 dash was to account for the acceleration period between may and september 30 and the risk that the pastoria project would be cancelled and / or the technology development fail in that period . in may ena gave up the opportunity to stick catalytica with " credits " as payment for the repurchase of the sso rather than cash if either of these events occured before september 30 and thereby lost the optionality of the four months . the may 2000 transaction did not change the economics of the deal in any other way than this acceleration . if the comment was intended to allocate the turbine overpricing which was part of the 1999 original transaction , i agree with you that this should have been handled at that time .my concern has been that enron retain the " benefit " of the credits referenced in the xtia which apparently has occurred . however , the fact apparently is that the credits had been rendered valueless from the start by the turbine overpricing .my framework had been that as long as enron received the credits in some form , the may 2000 transaction was a wash as far as i was concerned .dick .christopher f calger @ ect03 / 22 / 2001 07 : 58 pmto : richard lydecker / corp / enron @ enroncc :subject : re : out of interestdick , ,sounds as though this caught you by surprise - sorry for that . your chronology seems correct . this thing makes my head hurt every time it is brought up ! i believe the obligation was incurred dec 1999 , but not properly recognized / accounted for until the may , 2000 dash . delainey ' s hand - written note was the end result of people dissecting the deals with the realization that the west power turbines were overpriced by the $ 9 . 9 mm and the catalytica equity account did not properly account for that in dec 1999 .the turbine contract refers to a credit of $ 9 . 9 mm but the gross turbine price was increased by twice that amount so that the net increase was $ 9 . 9 mm . ena agreed to it because piper wanted to help catalytica . despite much protest from dave parquet , i agreed with delainey and ray bowen that west power would be on the hook for $ 3 . 3 mm of the $ 9 . 9 mm because the project got some benefit from catalytica . delainey wanted the payment triggered on sale of pastoria because he did not want my group to recognize any income until the project closed . this was communicated to and acknowledged by accounting and i reminded them of it every month or two since mid - year .i understand pat called sheila tweed - i dont think she ( or anyone ) remembers the details , but she should be able to validate the point about turbine overpricing and the delainey fix in may , 2000 .regards ,chrisrichard lydecker @ enron03 / 22 / 2001 05 : 19 pmto : christopher f calger / pdx / ect @ ectcc :subject : re : out of interestchris , i couldn ' t agree more about the confusing history of the catalytica xtia and spark spread derivative transactions . my understanding is slightly different from what you outline but you may have better sources . neither of us were present at the creation .i am familiar with dave delainey ' s hand - written note on the may 22 , 2000 dash . that dash authorised accelerating repurchase of the sso by three months . my view is that dave could allocate within ena at his discretion . i did not understand the rationale , however , since it was the december 14 , 1999 dash which established the obligation for enron to fund the $ 9 . 9 million . all the may 22 , 2000 dash did was unwind a financing arrangement three months early . it did not have anything to do with the incurrence of the obligation itself .the objective of the complex series of agreements was for enron to finance ge ' s development of the xonon technology and in return receive credits on turbine purchases either at pastoria or for other xonon - equiped turbines if pastoria were cancelled .original deal1 . catalytica agreed to purchase a spark spread option ( sso ) from enron for $ 9 . 9 million payable in four instalments . these instalments exactly matched the funding obligation to ge under the xtia .2 . catalytica actually paid enron $ 3 million which represented the first two instalments .3 . west lb made $ 3 million milestone payments to ge . the enron / west lp arrangement was an off balance sheet financing deal . at the end of the day , enron was paying ge .4 . by september 30 , 2000 enron was obligated to repurchase the sso from catalytica for the amount catalytica had paid enron or for turbine credits if pastoria were cancelled .may 2000 sso repurchase1 . enron bought back the sso from catalytica for $ 3 million . the three - month acceleration of repurchase was supposed to facilitate an ipo . it did not impact at all enron ' s ultimate obligation which had always been for the full $ 9 . 9 million .catalytica was now out of the chain and had no further payment obligations or credit entitlements .december 2000 final milestone payment to ge1 . enron has paid ge $ 9 . 9 million through the west lb financing arrangement ( now turbo park )i am uncertain whether ge increased the price of the pastoria turbines by $ 9 . 9 million as part of these transactions . my understanding was that there was concern about this when the turbine contract was negotiated , but i had thought this concern was to be guarded against in contract negotiation with ge . if in fact ge did increase the cost of the pastoria turbines by $ 9 . 9 million the entire purpose and benefit to enron from these incredibly complex and non - intuitive documents was totally obviated . net , net enron would have paid ge to develop a technology application with no compensatory value . why enron would have done this kind of deal i don ' t know .i ' m not sure what internal income transfer would apply . i understand that ge has applied the $ 9 . 9 million credit against a progress payment billing late last year . wouldn ' t this mean that the full credit was taken by pastoria ? it is unclear to me why the sale of pastoria should trigger anything .at the end of the day ena did the deal in 1999 and how we account for the consequences now is irrelevant . if the turbines were overpriced , the december 14 , 1999 dash seems to me to be misleading in not disclosing that fact when approval was requested . the dash actually states that the $ 9 . 9 million would " serve as a down payment for the pastoria turbine package .

Subject: neon retreatho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !bobby

Subject: california update 3 / 16 / 01? a source within the generator community confirms press reporting that coramenergy plans to file an involuntary bankruptcy early next week . through anintermediary , we were able to corroborate this information with a seniormember of the ca iso board . coram energy is a relatively small windgenerator qf based in west vancouver , british columbia , though it also ownswind stations in california . coram has 238 40 kw units .? the source believes that this filing may have been precipitated by thefact that many people believe it would take a blackout for governor davis tobe able to get his bailout plan passed by the legislature . it is unlikelythat blackouts would happen in april or may , meaning a long wait for thecash strapped qfs to wait to get paid .? the filing will be against socal .? in order to file an involuntary bankruptcy , coram would have to file alongwith at least two other creditors owed $ 10 , 000 or more . sources report coramhas two other creditors who will file with them ( working on finding out whothey are ) .? sources also report that other qfs are " taking legal advice " on how toproceed in light of these developments .

Subject: abb and texmexlouise ,it is possible that abb will raise the subject of our option with them for the construction of the hvdc tie while in our meeting tomorrow .as you know , we paid a considerable sum in the past for this option , which effectively expires at the end of november .under current market conditions , i think it will be possible to pay a much lower sum - and in fact , i think we can apply this sum against the abb contracted project cost in the event we proceed .no decisions are needed on this tomorrow , and it might not even come up - but clearly , we ' ve kept these guys hanging on the line for some time now and i expect that realistically we will not be in a position to give them a notice to proceed until middle of next year , given contracting and presidential permit issues .dave

Subject: re : suncor inc . - extension of services arrangementawesome !- - - - - original message - - - - -from : milnthorp , robsent : wednesday , october 03 , 2001 9 : 02 amto : lavorato , johncc : le dain , ericsubject : fw : suncor inc . - extension of services arrangementjohn , please see the attached . we are now 2 for 2 on extending our strategic alliances ( pcog keohane , petersubject : suncor inc . - extension of services arrangementrob ,yesterday i finalized negotiations with suncor for the extension of the services agreement . suncor / sunoco management at the executive vp level have approved the term and general rates , and execution of a letter agreement on the extension is expected to be a formality . we will wait for execution of the agreement nevertheless prior to booking origination .deal :1 . term - 3 years - january 1 , 2002 through december 31 , 20042 . services - as per todays services to all parts of the suncor and sunoco business , including their retail initiative . with respect to the retail initiative , we will only provide services to the retail company for its volumes up to 230 mmcfd . we provide services today for their current sales of 130 mmcfd . above 230 mmcfd we negotiate an additional rate .3 . price : yr 1 = $ 475 , 000 cdn ; yr 2 = $ 487 , 000 cdn ; yr 3 = $ 499 , 000 cdn4 . suncor gets a $ 70 , 000 cdn discount to be applied against the remainder of this year ' s fees , for the three months october , november , december 2001 the total base fee is $ 187 , 500 cdn - this will be cut to $ 117 , 500 cdn .4 . agreement - enron canada will prepare a letter agreement capturing the extension terms , similar to petro - canada .5 . incentive arrangement - as suncor is putting in place a new general mgr position to manage overall energy risks for the suncor group , we committed to wait for this person to be in place to negotiate an appropriate incentive arrangement . since we have provided the most value to suncor ' s consuming businesses over the years ( as e & p does very little ) it is appropriate to restructure the incentive to capture the value added to other parts of the business .enron ' s costs to provide the services are $ 168 , 444 cdn per year . this cost includes all accounting and operations staff , with an allocation of rent and infrastructure . we have five years of operating experience in providing these services and therefore are comfortable with this cost allocation . as in the case of the petro - canada renewal , the allocation of houston costs are insignificant on a per transaction basis compared to our base business . we do not include commercial staff in the above costs as they are covered through origination deal flow .we have made approximately $ 1 . 5 - $ 2 . 0 mm cdn each year ( including this year ) in deal flow from the suncor / sunoco alliance over the years of the relationship .the mtm income on this transaction is $ 830 , 000 cdn or approximately $ 530 , 000 us . i will allocate this amongst grant oh and myself .while the origination is not large on this transaction , the follow - on deal flow potential , based on past experience , is significant .again , as with petro - canada , we have a marquee client renewing services for an additional term with us after a five year initial term . this is a powerful marketing tool for the company vis a vis the quality of our services and commercial support .this renewal is a great credit to our operations , accounting , and commercial staff . we have had very few issues raised over the years with respect to the services provided in those areas , and have passed all audits performed by suncor . it also reflects very well on the hard work , and transaction / portfolio ideas of grant oh and nicole laporte on the commercial side ( and barry tycholiz and jason biever before them ) .this was not an easy deal to get done , in particular the three year commitment . you will recall that a year or so ago the odds of getting this done were probably 10 % . the key here was that we worked through and maintained relationships with up to five layers of the individual suncor and sunoco businesses , and we provided a very high level of service .peter ,would you please prepare the letter agreement this week for this transaction along the lines of the pcog extension letter . i ' ll stop by to discuss further . thanks .

Subject: proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to allaffiliatesngi ' s daily gas price indexbreaking news : posted sep 26 , 4 : 16 pmproposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliatesfederal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers , including both natural gas pipelines and power lines , to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate .previously , the rules simply required creation of a firewall , including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel , between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates . the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate , gas or electric , including financial affiliates .the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates , which still in many cases have bundled operations . one option would enforce complete separation , while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load . staff and commissioners wood , william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel , so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non - affiliated competitors did not have access to .commissioner linda breathitt , however , argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load . breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities , she was concerned about the timing . " i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . " she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . " i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge - building with state commissions . "wood said he understood " the political issue here with respect to federal - state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . " staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . " if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , " one staffer responded .wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost / benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , " but make it clear that if we don ' t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain ' t going to do it .

Subject: lincoln electriclouise ,i understand there is concern that the value associated with the assignment of the lincoln electric sales agreement to oppd is not sufficient to justify paying $ 1 . 3 million to oppd in order for them to assume this contract .there are some considerations on this contract which i think are important and which may not have been mentioned to you :- the original sales contract to lincoln was entered into several years ago and is one of the contracts sometimes referred to internally as " toxic waste " .- about a month ago , we agreed verbally with oppd to accept assignment of the sales contract , as oppd is one of the few parties which can serve it .- the execution of the documents has been delayed by lincoln , who were initially refusing to consent to the assignment- we have another , larger under - water transaction with oppd which we would like to move off the books at some point . we ' d like to keep oppd happy to improve the chances that we can negotiate their buyout of our other sales contract to them )- if we fail to deliver , we will be subject to penalties in the amount of $ 45 , 0000 per mw on top of liquidated damages ( lincoln is 15 mw for 02 and 30 mw for 03 ) .- this is a highly constrained area ( only 6 counterparties can physically deliver in this area and oppd is the only one which has the surplus power in order to serve lincoln ) : the chance that we will be unable to deliver is high .- there is intangible value associated with not being in a situation where enron fails to deliver .- even if we do wind up serving the contract , the highly constrained nature of the area means we will likely be forced to pay extortionate prices for the power we do acquire .- trading wishes to be out of this contract for aforementioned reasons and the fact that it will be very labour intensive to serve ( day - ahead notice on 20 % monthly load factor )obviously , if the above is not sufficient justification to put the money out the door now , then we will smooth things as much as possible with oppd - but i wanted to make sure you had all the info . before we kill the deal .terri has stalled oppd until monday .dave
Subject: re : peer group mappingsteve kean and i believe quite strongly , within a four peer group structure , that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of gov ' t . / public affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical - there is a clear divide between individuals in the gov ' t / public affairs groups who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and direct impact on commercial activities / net income ( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical ) . . . . and others who are performing a less strategic function ( who should remain in the commercial support category ) . with that said , it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for mid - year prc purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved ( for year - end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt ) . if we stay with the four group stucture , i intend to push hard for the remapping of gov ' t affairs by year - end .on a completely seperate issue , i continue to be very concerned about the impact of the " preferred " distribution relative to the bottom category for " commercial support " groups ( i ' m not implying this is ' nt an issue for commercial groups - i just don ' t have the same ability to assess the impact there ) . . . . the concern , simply stated , is that it may be entirely counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at enron , particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non - performers in my group and others were moved out of the company - the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a " preferred " distribution are quite high . . . and that is even before you begin to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour .thanks .enron energy services from : david w delainey @ ees 05 / 10 / 2001 10 : 26 amsent by : kay chapman @ eesto : david w delainey / hou / ees , philippe a bibi / hou / ect , tim belden / hou / ect , raymond bowen / hou / ect , michael r brown / lon / ect @ ect , rick buy / enron @ enronxgate , wes colwell / enron @ enronxgate , david cox / enron communications @ enron communications , janet r dietrich / hou / ees @ ees , w david duran / hou / ect @ ect , jim fallon / enron communications @ enron communications , ben glisan / hou / ect @ ect , joe gold / lon / ect @ ect , mark e haedicke / hou / ect @ ect , james a hughes / enron _ development , louise kitchen / hou / ect @ ect , michael kopper / hou / ect @ ect , john j lavorato / corp / enron , dan leff / hou / ees @ ees , jeffrey mcmahon / enron @ enronxgate , rob milnthorp / cal / ect @ ect , matthew scrimshaw / lon / ect @ ect , jeffrey a shankman / hou / ect , richard shapiro / na / enron @ enron , marty sunde / hou / ees @ eescc : kenneth lay / corp / enron @ enron , cliff baxter / hou / ect , james derrick / corp / enron , ken rice / enron communications @ enron communications , steven j kean / na / enron @ enron , greg whalley / hou / ect @ ect , stanley horton / corp / enron @ enron , jeff skilling / corp / enron @ enron , richard causey / corp / enron @ enron , kevin hannon / enron communications @ enron communications , andrew s fastow / hou / ect , mark frevert / na / enron , lou l pai / hou / ees @ ees , david oxley / hou / ect , drew c lynch / lon / ect @ ect , robert w jones / enron @ enronxgate , mary joyce / enron @ enronxgate , marla barnard / enron communications @ enron communications , kalen pieper / hou / ees @ ees , gary p smith / ots / enron @ enron , cindy skinner / hou / ect , andrea yowman / corp / enron @ enron , cindy olson / corp / enron @ enron , gina corteselli / corp / enron , elspeth inglis / corp / enronsubject : peer group mappingfollowing my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units . this mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at year end 2000 vp prc .we were considering moving to a 3 peer group structure however it as agreed at the last prc committee meeting to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just 2 or 3 . it was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 peer groups . all functions / activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached .the actions points from this excercise are :1 to review and agree the attached mapping2 consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous prc meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them as indicated on the attachment .3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation .please return your comments to david oxley by friday may 25 .to have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final vp / md prc meetings . definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease ofreference .

( our up - stream is pac ) .we originally thought that this got booked out between mirant and wapa , but when i spoke with kathy yesterday , she informed me that there was no bookout and that they want to cut the schedule . ( the people involved during the cut were geir at epmi , bob at pac , emily at mirant , and jackie for wapa ( jackie is a control area dispatcher , so she cannot do bookouts for wapa , hence there was no bookout ) ) .we have agreed that to cut the schedule will be the best for now . they do not plan on charging us ld ' s ( she ' s checking with her boss to make sure . ) we will just reduce the schedules to 25 for he 11 .it is up to you if you want to charge ld ' s to mirant for the spread .just wanted to let you know and get your input .virginia

Subject: nice teen fucked so hardhello , playmates ! : ) tunaalabaganaleadership involves finding a parade and getting in front of it . ambition is a lust that is never quenched , but grows more inflamed and madder by enjoyment . we judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing , while others judge us by what we have already done . whatever deceives men seems to produce a magical enchantment . pandemonium did not reign it poured . there is no love sincerer than the love of food .he that is conscious of guilt cannot bear the innocence of others : so they will try to reduce all others to their own level . competition is a process or variety of habitual behavior that grows out of a habit of mind . it has yet to be proven that intelligence has any survival value .he is mad past recovery , but yet he has lucid intervals .there are more love songs than anything else . if songs could make you do something we ' d all love one another .nothing dies harder than a bad idea .failure too is a form of death . . . writing about music is like dancing about architecture it ' s a really stupid thing to want to do . love is only chatter , friends are all that matter .be not curious in unnecessary matters : for more things are shrewd unto thee than men understand .one of the striking differences between a cat and a lie is that the cat has only nine lives . man is emphatically a proselytizing creature .

Subject: upw presents : meltdown - wednesday july 20 th !wednesday ,july 20 th , 20058 : 00 pmmeltdown only hours away !that  s right , as we speak , i am counting down the hours , minutes , and seconds until upw once again invades its old stomping grounds ( literally ) at the galaxy theatre . as if the upw returns of luther  horshu  reigns , sakoda , kazarian and hardkore kidd , 10 huge matches , and a musical performance by tijuana bullfight were not enough lil nate : out to prove that he is for real .at upw  s last outing at the galaxy ,  homecoming havoc  , one of the unquestionable highlights was lil nate  s upset victory over the longest reigning lightweight champion in upw history , frankie kazarian . the match was a true classic back and forth battle in which nate finally bested kazarian with a reversal and roll up . since then , many have stated that nate  s victory was a fluke , and that he will be unable to live up to kazarian  s lofty standards .the current lightweight champion is no stranger to having the odds against him , in fact , he thrives on it . nate began training at the young age of 14 . at 135 lbs . soaking wet along with a big red afro , just about everyone broke into laughter when they heard of nate  s intentions to become a wrestler . as it turns out , it would be the perennial underdog who would have the last laugh . since he started his training , nate has blossomed into one of southern california  s most dynamic and talented in - ring performers . he recently helped wwe  s best prepare for their wrestlemania 21 matches as he participated in the pre - mania workouts sessions . he has also been on the road with hall of famer , rowdy roddy piper . now he finds himself the upw lightweight champion after scoring the biggest win of his career . it is now on to the next challenge , proving that he is a deserving champion . nate made it clear that he would be a fighting champion who will take on the best lightweight challengers in and out ofupw . he will have a chance to do just that when he defends the gold against davie richards at meltdown . richards who has wrestled matches for wwe , tna , nwa , pwg , and other promotions will bring his skills and wealth of experience into a upw ring for the first time . will nate silence his critics with a successful defense , or will richards capture lightning in a bottle and the upw lightweight championship in his upw debut ? regardless , this should be a very competitive title match .skulu and predator clash in a battle of upw  s big men !while nate and richards will most likely put on a clinic when it comes to high - flying and scientific wrestling , don  t expect too much in the way of finesse as two of upw  s biggest and most popular superstars lock horns in this  colossal jostle  ! both men have gleaming win / loss records in upw . as a result , it is very difficult to pick a favorite in this one . both have become international stars in japan . predator is in the best condition of his life as he has been training for mixed martial arts competition as part of valor fighting . if the match goes past the five - minute mark , predator may have the advantage due to conditioning . countering that is the fact that skulu will have no less than 30 family members and friends on hand to cheer him on . will this be enough to inspire the powerful polynesian to pick up a very rare victory over predator ? make sure you are on hand to find out !japan  s sumie sakai makes upw debut @ meltdown !as a special added bonus attraction , one of the most respected and impressive female performers from japan , sumie sakai will make her upw debut at the galaxy . this is another example of how upw is working to showcase the skills of many of the world  s greatest grapplers for its dedicated southern california fans . over the years upw has brought in the likes of ohtani , tanaka , hoshikowa , konnan , psicosis , juventud guerrera , the late great shinya hashimoto , and many more . no word yet on who sakai will battle in her debut match .alltickets only $ 15ticketson sale now :the galaxy box office ( 714 - 957 - 0600 ) , ticketmaster outlets andticketmaster . comfeaturingappearances byfeaturingin in ring action :the masterpiecechris mastersfrankiekazariansakodahardkorekiddjesus aguileraupwheavyweight championtom howard- vs -lutherhorshu reignsskulu- vs -thepredatoroldschoololiverjohn- vs -joeyryanupwlightweight championlil ' nate- vs -davie richardsscottlost- vs -antonio mestreupwtag team championsthe ballard brothers- vs -the southside g ' striplethreat tag team matchtommy wilsonshawn riddikthe good guyslionheartthe human tornadoalsofeaturing in in - ring action :ma ' koaandrew hellmancardsubject to changefeaturinga live musical performance by :tijuanabullfight ' s official websitelistento a sample oftijuana bullfight :streamlo - fi mp 3streamhi - fi mp 3mp 3streams courtesy of cdbaby . comwednesday , july 20 th , 20058 : 00 pmalltickets only $ 15ticketson sale now :the galaxy box office ( 714 - 957 - 0600 ) , ticketmasteroutlets and ticketmaster . comtobe removed from the upw mailing list , please send a blank email withremove in the subject field to news @ upw . com

Subject: reply soon ! ! !dear sir ,i know this email will reach you as a surprise , but need not to worry as we are using theonly secured and confidential medium available to seekfor foreign assistance in a business .it is with heartfelt hope that i write to seek your co - operation andassistance in the context stated below : may i first introduce my self : i amdr . ( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( formermilitary head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria )who died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet asi was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children ,hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband .i have lost confidence with anybody within the country .having noted the confidence reposed on your person ,i became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receivingthe sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general( my husband ) .this money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i haveall documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault forsafe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also toavoid it been spent by unauthorized persons .it is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from myorganisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of thisorganisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf .on your acceptance to render this assistance to meto invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to aconclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used fornon - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilianadministration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of thefederal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha familybecause of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my latehusband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government haveresolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha includingproperties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize thevarious bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact ,the attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent ofseizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of ourfamily in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband .in view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , ourfamily trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company hascalled me to do something about claiming this consignment because of thedemurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it verysoon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseasamount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will cometo my full assistance and unlimitedco - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the wholefamily members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently livingon goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for thesinsof my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthyand kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and mychildren from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we willcompensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % ofthe total amount of $ 20 million us dollars .in that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into yourdiscrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % inyour favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed byyou . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for mychildren ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements withthe trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safeoperation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the financecompany where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fideowner . and in due course , all contacts must be made throughdr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com andphone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal .i look forward to your quick response while thankingyou for your co - operation . in view of all abovedetails , i request you to keep this letter andco - operation highly confidential .best wishes ,mrs . mariam abacha .
